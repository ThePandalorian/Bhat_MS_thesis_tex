	abstract = {A plethora of different theories, models, and concepts make up the field of community ecology. Amid this vast body of work, is it possible to build one general theory of ecological communities? What other scientific areas might serve as a guiding framework? As it turns out, the core focus of community ecology—understanding patterns of diversity and composition of biological variants across space and time—is shared by evolutionary biology and its very coherent conceptual framework, population genetics theory. The Theory of Ecological Communities takes this as a starting point to pull together community ecology's various perspectives into a more unified whole. Mark Vellend builds a theory of ecological communities based on four overarching processes: selection among species, drift, dispersal, and speciation. These are analogues of the four central processes in population genetics theory—selection within species, drift, gene flow, and mutation—and together they subsume almost all of the many dozens of more specific models built to describe the dynamics of communities of interacting species. The result is a theory that allows the effects of many low-level processes, such as competition, facilitation, predation, disturbance, stress, succession, colonization, and local extinction to be understood as the underpinnings of high-level processes with widely applicable consequences for ecological communities. Reframing the numerous existing ideas in community ecology, The Theory of Ecological Communities provides a new way for thinking about biological composition and diversity.},

	abstract = {The debate between niche-based and neutral community theories centers around the question of which forces shape predominantly ecological communities. Niche theory attributes a central role to niche differences between species, which generate a difference between the strength of intra- and interspeciﬁc interactions. Neutral theory attributes a central role to migration processes and demographic stochasticity. One possibility to bridge these two theories is to combine them in a common mathematical framework. Here we propose a mathematical model that integrates the two perspectives. From a nichebased perspective, our model can be interpreted as a Lotka–Volterra model with symmetric interactions in which we introduce immigration and demographic stochasticity. From a neutral perspective, it can be interpreted as Hubbell’s local community model in which we introduce a difference between intra- and interspeciﬁc interactions. We investigate the stationary species abundance distribution and other community properties as functions of the interaction coefﬁcient, the immigration rate and the strength of demographic stochasticity.},

	abstract = {The plethora of studies devoted to the topics of male competition and female mate choice belie the fact that their interaction remains poorly understood. Indeed, on the question of whether competition should help or hinder the choice process, opinions scattered throughout the sexual selection literature seem unnecessarily polarised. We argue, in the light of recent theoretical and empirical advances, that the effect of competition on mate choice depends on whether it results in the choosy sex attaining high breeding value for total fitness, considering both direct and indirect fitness benefits. Specifically, trade-offs may occur between different fitness benefits if some are correlated with male competitive ability whilst others are not. Moreover, the costs and benefits of mating with competitive males may vary in time and/or space. These considerations highlight the importance of injecting a life-history perspective into sexual selection studies. Within this context, we turn to the sexual selection literature to try to offer insights into the circumstances when competition might be expected to have positive or negative implications for pre-copulatory female choice. In this regard, we elaborate on three stages where competition might impact upon the choice process: (i) during mate detection, (ii) mate evaluation, and (iii) in dictating actual mating outcomes. We conclude by offering researchers several potentially rewarding avenues for future research.},

In the absence of such a cost, ‘cheats’, that lie about their states or needs, are able to evolve and exploit the preferences of receivers. We show here that spatial constraints imposed on the interactions between signallers and receivers favour honest signalling even in the absence of any costs: ‘islands’ of honesty coexist in ‘seas’ of dishonesty. The extent to which honest or dishonest strategies are favoured, is shown to depend upon the relative payoffs from signalling and receiving. As the receiving component of fitness becomes greater than the signalling component of fitness, as might be true in ‘life-dinner’ type interactions, honesty is increasingly favoured. In addition, in spatial populations, honesty can be favoured locally even when the mean global payoffs to honesty are lower than the mean payoffs to dishonesty. Our model provides a general framework for analysing signals in spatially structured populations and might therefore apply to signalling in both natural and cultural situations.},

In field crickets, males calling may attract acoustically orienting parasitoid flies. Alternatively, males behaving as satellites forgo calling and attempt to intercept females attracted to callers. We modeled the contribution of calling versus satellite behavior to male reproductive success in the larger context of variation in ecology (parasitism rate, background mortality), demography (density, sex ratio), and female behavior (phonotaxis, mating choosiness). Male mating success was most influenced by number of females (standardized effect size 0.42), followed by female choosiness (0.33), background mortality (−0.31), number of males (−0.28), and parasitism rate (−0.21). The smallest effects were phonotaxis (0.10) and satellite behavior (−0.09). Although satellite behavior ameliorated negative effects of parasitism, its comparative effect was slight. {ARTs} seem most likely to evolve and persist when a single selection pressure on signaling is particularly strong.},

Here, we present the results of a three-strategy game, where reproductive parasites interact with two resource defenders: ‘Susceptibles’ defend more resources but lose more reproductive success to parasites. ‘Immunes’ lose less to parasites, but immunity carries a reproductive cost. We show that the inclusion of a third strategy dramatically changes the evolutionary dynamics, such that for a wide range of parameter values, our model predicts the continuous sequential invasion of the three strategies instead of stable coexistence. Our results therefore limit the generality of the prediction that frequency-dependent fitness necessarily allows alternative reproductive tactics to coexist at equilibrium and may also explain the observed dynamics of some multiple-strategy systems.},

While there is great variation in which sex searches, previous theory has not considered search evolution when both males and females benefit from multiple mating. We present new theory and link it with data to bridge this gap. Two different search protocols exist between species in the bush-cricket genus Poecilimon (Orthoptera): females search for calling males, or males search for calling females. Poecilimon males also transfer a costly nuptial food gift to their mates during mating. We relate variations in searching protocols to variation in nuptial gift size among 32 Poecilimon taxa. As predicted, taxa where females search produce significantly larger nuptial gifts than those where males search. Our model and results show that search roles can reverse when multiple mating brings about sufficiently strong material benefits to females.},

Males usually invest more in this costly activity than females, but the reasons for this are poorly understood. Previous models have shown that female-biased parental investment, including anisogamy, does not by itself select for male-biased mate searching, so it requires additional explanations. Here, we correct and expand upon earlier models, and present two novel hypotheses that might explain the evolution of male-biased mate searching. The “carry-over hypothesis” states that females benefit less from searching if the associated costs affect other stages of the life cycle, rather than arising only while searching. It is relevant to the evolution of morphological traits that improve searching efficiency but are also expressed in other contexts. The “mating window hypothesis” states that females benefit less from searching if their life cycle includes intervals during which the exact timing of mating does not matter for the appropriate timing of reproduction (e.g., due to sperm storage or delayed embryo implantation). Such intervals are more likely to exist for females given the general pattern of greater female parental investment. Our models shed new light on classic arguments about sex role evolution.},

	abstract = {Sexual selection depends on differential patterns of mate preference and choice. Little attention has been paid, however, to the manner in which individuals acquire information about the quality of potential mates and how this information is used to form mating decisions. Different decision rules for determining mating preferences often lead to different fitness consequences for the actively searching and choosy sex. In this paper, I compare the expected fitness consequences of two alternative decision-making strategies: a best-of-n strategy (whereby searching individuals choose the best mate from a sample of size n) and a strategy based on sequential sampling (whereby the searching individual establishes a critical mate quality and continues searching until encountering a mate at or above this quality). For the same distribution of potential mate qualities, the sequential-search strategy generates higher expected fitness gains than the best-of-n strategy. This is in contrast to earlier conclusions (e.g., Janetos 1980; Halliday 1983) that the best-of-n is a dominant strategy for mate choice. In the models presented here, the cost of mate search is included; earlier models neglected this important aspect of mate choice, and this difference accounts for the different conclusions. The sequential-search model establishes a critical mate-acceptance level that equates the cost of sampling one additional potential mate and the expected fitness gain from one additional search. As the cost of search increases, the critical threshold decreases. The basic sequential-search model can be extended to include time discounting, finite time horizon, systematic search, learning, variable search costs, and mate responsiveness. In each extension, new critical thresholds for mate acceptability can be established. In some cases, such as an extension to include a finite time horizon, the critical threshold is anticipated to undergo a monotonic decline as search progresses: searchers become less choosy over time if they are unsuccessful at finding mates. The role of the arithmetic mean and variance of fitness among potential mates can be explored within these simple models. As the mean and variance of mate quality within the population increases, the critical threshold for acceptability increases. The basic model and its extensions are subject to easy empirical testing. These models will prove valuable in establishing the link between aspects of individual behavior and population-level selection processes.},

Signal receivers perform a combination of random search and navigation before and after signal detections. On the other hand, signal senders can also modify their movement patterns to optimize their encounter rates, which invokes a reverse side of random search problems that asks for the most efficient movement patterns of signal senders to be found by signal receivers. In this study, we focused on visual and auditory signals in particular, and quantified the efficiency of mating encounters of individual animals performing a Lévy walk, a special class of random walk, with a variety of speeds before signal detection. We found that signal senders should move more slowly and/or less diffusively than receivers to improve mating encounters. The optimal movement patterns of senders ranged from relatively slow to stationary ones depending on the density of individuals, the effective range of signals, and the ability of receivers to locate senders. By focusing on the optimal movement patterns of individuals that are often assumed to be given targets, the present study provides insights into strategies of effective attraction beyond the case of mate search.},

conditions. Here we examined reproductive tactics in relation to the

elaboration of condition-dependent sexual ornamentation (carotenoid breast

coloration) in a Montana population of the house finches (Carpodacus

mexicanus). Males used distinct reproductive tactics depending on

elaboration of their sexual ornamentation. Males with red pigmentation

(maximum ornament elaboration) paired with females that nested earlier, but

these males did little provisioning of incubating females and nestlings. In

contrast, males with yellow coloration paired with females that nested later,

but these males fed female and nestlings more. Consequently, for red males

offspring recruitment was primarily affected by earlier nest initiation,

whereas in yellow males it was affected most by male provisioning. In males

with intermediate plumage coloration, all measured components, nest

initiation, provisioning of incubating female, and nestling feeding, strongly

contributed to offspring recruitment. The fitness consequences of alternative

reproductive tactics of males were influenced by breeding experience and

fidelity of their mates. Among first-time breeders, red males achieved the

highest fecundity because of the advantage gained through early nesting and

pairing with more experienced females and because of compensation by their

mates for low male provisioning of nestlings. Among experienced breeders,

males with intermediate plumage coloration achieved the highest fecundity

because of the combined benefits of relatively early pairing and high parental

care. High variation in sexual ornamentation in a Montana population of house

finches may favor distinct associations of sexual displays with a particular

set of reproductive behaviors.},

This 'Diminishing Returns Effect' affords mating opportunities for Satellite males associated with the most attractive sites (or males). A graphical Satellite Threshold Model, analogous to the Polygyny Threshold Model (Orians 1969), is developed to predict quantitatively the presence or absence of Satellite male tactics. Five predictions of the Model are supported quantitatively by data from dragonfly and anuran social systems and, more generally, by evidence from a wide variety of species.

We develop the model for the social system of the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher but the general framework is also applicable to other cooperative systems. In addition to behaving cooperatively by sharing tasks, sexually mature male cichlid helpers may directly parasitize the reproduction of dominant breeders in the group. We investigate the relative influence of life history and behavioural variables including growth, parasitism capacity, future reproductive fitness benefits and costs, relatedness and expulsion risk on the optimal reproductive strategy of subordinates. In a detailed analysis of the parameter space we show that a male helper should base its decision to parasitize primarily on an increase in expulsion risk resulting from reproductive parasitism (punishment), intra-group relatedness and the parasitism capacity. If expulsion risk is high then helpers should not parasitize reproduction at medium body size but should parasitize either when small or large.},

The results also show that conditional and unconditional development can be maintained in one of two ways: by frequency‐dependent selection or by the maintenance of genetic variation that exceeds the threshold for induction. We then modified the model to take into account variance in exposures to the environmental cue as well as variance in response to the cue, which allows a derivation of a dose‐response curve. Here the results showed that increasing the genetic variance for response both flattens and shifts the dose‐response curve. Finally, we modify the model to derive the dose‐response curve for a population polymorphic for a gene that blocks expression of the conditional strategy. We illustrate the utility of the model by application to predator‐induced defense in an intertidal barnacle and compare the results with phenotypic models of selection.},

	abstract = {Discrete variation where one sex has more than one means of achieving the same functional end, such as mating or nesting (alternative strategies and tactics), requires an evolutionary explanation. Discrete differences in behavior, morphology, color, and life-history patterns are found in many contexts, such as alternative reproductive patterns, social insect castes, sex allocation, and mimicry polymorphisms. In this chapter I draw on the literature of these fields to identify similar patterns and common models that can be applied to our understanding of alternative phenotypes in general. I emphasize the invertebrate literature throughout because excellent reviews are available for vertebrates. Traditionally, the behavioral literature has separated alternative phenotypes into those due to genetic differences (e.g., polymorphisms) and those due to environmental or individual cues (e.g., conditional tactics). Such categories are impractical and they force us to dichotomize behavior as due to nature or nurture. Drawing on the well-developed sex-allocation literature, I suggest a different system for categorizing alternative phenotypes: irreversible or adult lifetime patterns (e.g., dioecy) and reversible or facultative patterns (e.g., hermaphroditism), which can be further subdivided into sequential and simultaneous. This new system for organizing alternative phenotypes allows us to see that condition dependence and frequency dependence may occur under any category. In general, alternative phenotypes can be maintained in a population when their fitness curves cross, that is, when each does better than the other under some conditions. A variety of factors can cause fitness curves to cross. Negative frequency dependence is one, which has the added advantage of explaining how patterns can be maintained at a stable frequency. Probably the most common explanation for the maintenance of discrete variants is switches in phenotype based on environmental or individual, condition-based cues. What are the circumstances that favor the evolution of irreversible phenotypes over switching? Lifetime patterns are favored when individuals that switch have lower fitness than those that do not. Lifetime patterns allow complex suites of adaptations to develop for each phenotype that are coordinated through physiological and developmental processes. When environmental conditions are predictable and correlate with fitness, selection favors the animal switching from one pattern to the other at the time that maximizes fitness. However, when the environmental conditions that favor two phenotypes are unpredictable and change frequently, selection favors animals that invest in what is necessary to perform in either role. Under most circumstances the animal will use decision rules based on information about what maximizes fitness, but if the individual does not have such information, yet must choose between exclusive alternatives, then selection will favor an arbitrary decision rule. A promising approach to studying alternative phenotypes is dynamic, state-variable modeling (Houston and {McNamara}, 1999; Clark and Mangel, 2000), which is particularly good for evaluating the interacting effects of the organism's state, of environmental and social conditions, and of density and frequency dependence. When such multiple factors are evaluated together, surprising predictions about the conditions under which individuals should follow particular patterns sometimes result. An understanding of the evolution of alternative phenotypes requires a strong, integrative approach that seeks to understand the cues and mechanisms controlling behavioral decisions. When this approach is combined with dynamic, state-based models, it is possible to make predictions about the circumstances that favor the evolution of particular decision-making patterns over others.},

First, it considers a scheme into which examples of alternative tactics can be placed. This scheme reveals specific assumptions that are frequently made about alternative tactics and the problems involved in their measurement. The paper then discusses the shortcomings of dichotomizing alternative tactics into discrete categories, focusing particularly on the genes/environment distinction. Developmental phenomena that can give rise to discontinuous variation in behaviour are then related to specific examples from species that show alternative tactics. Several developmental phenomena are likely to be involved in the origins of any particular case of intraspecific variation in behaviour. Factors in development may have canalizing effects, facilitating effects, or they may maintain variation in behaviour. They may also enable alternative tactics to occur or initiate their appearance in either juveniles or adults. Three aspects of the processes involved in generating such variation in behaviour are also discussed. These are the interactions between genetic and environmental influences, alternative routes in development, and learning. However, in no case is a particular developmental phenomenon or process likely to be solely responsible for a particular example of discontinuous variation in behaviour; new ontogenetic analyses are required to uncover the multiple influences.},

We evaluated the fitness consequences for males adopting one of four alternative strategies : calling, satelliting, foraging, or hiding. Various factors potentially influence male behavior, including energy reserves, predation risk, cost of calling, probability of finding food, distribution of male energy states in the population, and probability of surviving to another breeding season. We manipulated these parameters to determine how strongly each affects breeding phenology and chorus structure. Manipulating parameters related to the energetic costs and benefits of individual decisions, we generated the three basic patterns of anuran breeding phenology : explosive, continuous, and prolonged breeding with episodic chorusing. Increasing the probability of successful foraging caused a shift from an explosive pattern to a prolonged, episodic chorusing pattern. Decreasing the calling cost resulted in continuous chorusing. Our model predicted that satelliting will be a rare strategy adopted by individuals with relatively low energy reserves. Additionally, individuals adopting the satellite strategy should alternate among satelliting, foraging, and calling as their energy reserves fluctuate. Our results suggest that energetic costs of reproduction and resource limitation may be crucial factors influencing the phenology of anuran chorusing. We propose that under varying conditions of resource availability, male decisions are the consequence of two strategies : a starvation minimization strategy and an energy-state maximization strategy.},

	abstract = {William D. Hamilton famously stated that “human life is a many person game and not just a disjoined collection of two person games”. However, most of the theoretical results in evolutionary game theory have been developed for two player games. In spite of a multitude of examples ranging from humans to bacteria, multi-player games have received less attention than pairwise games due to their inherent complexity. Such complexities arise from the fact that group interactions cannot always be considered as a sum of multiple pairwise interactions. Mathematically, multi-player games provide a natural way to introduce non-linear, polynomial fitness functions into evolutionary game theory, whereas pairwise games lead to linear fitness functions. Similarly, studying finite populations is a natural way of introducing intrinsic stochasticity into population dynamics. While these topics have been dealt with individually, few have addressed the combination of finite populations and multi-player games so far. We are investigating the dynamical properties of evolutionary multi-player games in finite populations. Properties of the fixation probability and fixation time, which are relevant for rare mutations, are addressed in well mixed populations. For more frequent mutations, the average abundance is investigated in well mixed as well as in structured populations. While the fixation properties are generalizations of the results from two player scenarios, addressing the average abundance in multi-player games gives rise to novel outcomes not possible in pairwise games.},

	abstract = {Should a parent care for its young or abandon them before they reach independence? We consider parental care behaviour as an adaptive decision, involving trade–offs between current and future reproduction. The condition of the parent is expected to influence these trade–offs. Using a dynamic programming model we explore how changes in the levels of energetic reserves, and time in the season, determine changes in parental care decisions. The novel feature of our model is that we have included the possibility of remating within the current breeding season in a consistent manner by explicitly modelling the behaviour of unmated animals. We show that there may be several fluctuations in the average duration of care during the breeding season. We also show that, because of the dependence of parental care behaviour on both the condition of the parent and time during the breeding season, changing some of the costs of care may increase the duration of care during one part of the season and decrease it at another. The model also shows that the conditions prevailing for animals with dependent offspring can affect the way in which an unmated animal behaves. For example, the behaviour of unmated animals may change to compensate (partly) for increases in the costs of raising offspring, which are produced at a later date (for example, by increasing the duration of foraging between breeding attempts). Overall, the model provides a good framework for understanding how various ecological and life–history variables should influence parental care behaviour during a breeding season.},

Similarly, wildlife and fishery managers must make tradeoffs while striving for conservation or economic goals (e.g. costs vs. rewards). Stochastic dynamic programming ({SDP}) provides a powerful and flexible framework within which to explore these tradeoffs. A rich body of mathematical results on {SDP} exist but have received little attention in ecology and evolution. Using directed graphs – an intuitive visual model representation – we reformulated {SDP} models into matrix form. We synthesized relevant existing theoretical results which we then applied to two canonical {SDP} models in ecology and evolution. We applied these matrix methods to a simple illustrative patch choice example and an existing {SDP} model of parasitoid wasp behaviour. The proposed analytical matrix methods provide the same results as standard numerical methods as well as additional insights into the nature and quantity of other, nearly optimal, strategies, which we may also expect to observe in nature. The mathematical results highlighted in this work also explain qualitative aspects of model convergence. An added benefit of the proposed matrix notation is the resulting ease of implementation of Markov chain analysis (an exact solution for the realized states of an individual) rather than Monte Carlo simulations (the standard, approximate method). It also provides an independent validation method for other numerical methods, even in applications focused on short-term, non-stationary dynamics. These methods are useful for obtaining, interpreting, and further analysing model convergence to the optimal time-independent (i.e. stationary) decisions predicted by an {SDP} model. {SDP} is a powerful tool both for theoretical and applied ecology, and an understanding of the mathematical structure underlying {SDP} models can increase our ability to apply and interpret these models.},

We address this problem via a stochastic dynamic programming model of mate choice. In the model, a female encounters males sequentially and must choose whether to mate or continue searching. As the female searches, her own condition changes stochastically, and she incurs condition-dependent search costs. The female attempts to maximize the quality of the offspring, which is a function of the female’s condition at mating and the quality of the male with whom she mates. The mating strategy that maximizes the female’s net expected reward is a quality threshold. We compare the optimal policy with other well-known mate choice strategies, and we use simulations to examine how well the optimal policy fares under imperfect information.},

Although the caller-satellite system in crickets that risk detection by parasitoids resembles distinct behavioral phenotypes, a male’s propensity to behave as caller or satellite can be a continuously variable trait over several temporal scales, and an individual may pursue alternate tactics at different times. We modeled a caller-satellite-parasitoid system as a spatially explicit interaction among male and female crickets using individual-based simulation. Males varied in their propensity to call versus behave as a satellite from one night to the next. We varied mortality, density, sex ratio, and female mating behavior, and recorded lifetime number of mates as a function of a male’s probability of calling (vs. acting as a satellite) along a gradient in parasitism risk. Frequently, the optimal behavior switched abruptly from being pure caller (call every night) to pure satellite (never call) as parasitism rate increased. However, mixed strategies prevailed even with high parasitism risk under conditions of higher background mortality rate, decreasing density, increasing female-biased sex ratio, and increasing female choosiness. In natural populations, high parasitoid pressure alone would be unlikely to yield fixation of pure satellite behavior.},

An asymptotic relationship between age and {RHP} should result in most males in a population having essentially equal {RHP}. Several ways exist for males to partition the set of mating opportunities between two or more “equal {AMTs}.”Transient tactics may occur if (i) resources for females and territorial males differ and do not covary positively in their distribution, or (ii) local areas are so attractive to females that males effectively cannot defend them. We suggest Levins' (1968) “fitness set” analysis as a useful model predicting whether a male should specialize on a single tactic, or partition its effort between the two tactics.},

	abstract = {We examine the evolutionary stability of strategies for dispersal in heterogeneous patchy environments or for switching between discrete states (e.g. defended and undefended) in the context of models for population dynamics or species interactions in either continuous or discrete time. There have been a number of theoretical studies that support the view that in spatially heterogeneous but temporally constant environments there will be selection against unconditional, i.e. random, dispersal, but there may be selection for certain types of dispersal that are conditional in the sense that dispersal rates depend on environmental factors. A particular type of dispersal strategy that has been shown to be evolutionarily stable in some settings is balanced dispersal, in which the equilibrium densities of organisms on each patch are the same whether there is dispersal or not. Balanced dispersal leads to a population distribution that is ideal free in the sense that at equilibrium all individuals have the same fitness and there is no net movement of individuals between patches or states. We find that under rather general assumptions about the underlying population dynamics or species interactions, only such ideal free strategies can be evolutionarily stable. Under somewhat more restrictive assumptions (but still in considerable generality), we show that ideal free strategies are indeed evolutionarily stable. Our main mathematical approach is invasibility analysis using methods from the theory of ordinary differential equations and nonnegative matrices. Our analysis unifies and extends previous results on the evolutionary stability of dispersal or state-switching strategies.},

General frequency‐dependent models of migratory dynamics that differ in the degree of animal omniscience are then developed. These models do not exclude migration at the {IFD} where balanced dispersal emerges. It is shown that the population distribution converges to the {IFD} even when animals are nonideal (i.e., they do not know the quality of all patches). In particular, the {IFD} emerges when animals never migrate from patches with a higher payoff to patches with a lower payoff and when some animals always migrate to the best patch. It is shown that some random migration does not necessarily lead to undermatching, provided migration occurs at the {IFD}. The effect of population dynamics on the {IFD} (and vice versa) is analyzed. Without any migration, it is shown that population dynamics alone drive the population distribution to the {IFD}. If animal migration tends (for each fixed population size) to the {IFD}, then the combined migration‐population dynamics evolve to the population {IFD} independent of the two timescales (i.e., behavioral vs. population).},

Under such conditions, the capacity to generate variable offspring spreads the risk of being maladapted in the present environment, against offspring likely to have some chance of survival in the future. While a rich subject for theoretical studies, little is known about the selective causes responsible for the evolutionary emergence of stochastic phenotype switching. Here we review recent work – both theoretical and experimental – that sheds light on ecological factors that favour switching types over non-switching types. Of particular relevance is an experiment that provided evidence for an adaptive origin of stochastic phenotype switching by subjecting bacterial populations to a selective regime that mimicked essential features of the host immune response. Central to the emergence of switching types was frequent imposition of ‘exclusion rules’ and ‘population bottlenecks’ – two complementary faces of frequency dependent selection. While features of the immune response, exclusion rules and bottlenecks are likely to operate in many natural environments. Together these factors define a set of selective conditions relevant to the evolution of stochastic switching, including antigenic variation and bacterial persistence.},

These models predict that intra-specific heterogeneity in defence levels resolves the paradox of enrichment for a range of top-down effects that affect consumer death rates and for all possible levels of primary productivity. We show analytically that this stability can be understood in terms of differences in handling times on the different prey types. Our predictions still hold when defences also affect consumer attack rates. The predicted stability occurs in both bitrophic and tritrophic food chains. Inducible defences may promote population persistence in tritrophic food chains. Here the minimum densities of cycling populations remain bound away from zero, thus decreasing the risk of population extinctions. However, the reverse can be true for the equivalent bitrophic predator–prey model. This shows that theoretical extrapolations from simple to complex communities should be made with caution. Our results show that inducible defences are among the ecological factors that promote stability in multitrophic communities.},

	abstract = {To understand the evolution of polyphenism, or adaptive switching between alternative developmental pathways and corresponding phenotypes, environmental factors governing the developmental switch, or cues, must be distinguished from factors affecting relative fitnesses, or selective agents. Under most conditions of purely spatial variation in environment, the maintenance of polyphenism requires adaptive developmental sensitivity to cues, which results in phenotype-environment matching. Other determinants of the maintenance of polyphenism under spatial variation include relative fitnesses of different phenotype-environment combinations, frequencies of alternative environments, and possible costs of polyphenism. Where variation is temporal, polyphenism is affected by the same parameters but is maintained more readily and may be favored without adaptive developmental sensitivity Even where environmental conditions are sufficient for maintaining polyphenism, its evolution may be precluded by constraints on developmental sensitivity that prevent phenotype-environment matching, costs of developmental switching, or antagonistic pleiotropy that prevents independent evolution of alternative phenotypes. These factors could be highly taxon-specific, which would preclude generalizations concerning the distribution of polyphenism. However, the abundance of seasonal polyphenisms in multivoltine organisms suggests that where environments are favorable, developmental systems are often flexible enough for the establishment of simple polyphenisms. Elaborate polyphenisms may be restricted to circumstances in which the developmental switch occurs during very early development},

Why should selection produce distinctly different alternatives to reach the same goal? How can such alternative solutions coexist in a population? What determines their evolutionary stability? Here we outline ultimate and proximate mechanisms responsible for the origin, coexistence and stability of {ARTs}. We argue that behavioural and reproductive polymorphisms often reflect different allocation decisions in response to trade-offs in reproduction or life-history optima that may involve heritable threshold responses to environmental variation. Alternative tactics may either be fixed for life or plastic, with simultaneous or sequential switches between tactics. General principles include disruptive selection, negative frequency dependence, density dependence, and an interaction between genetic and environmental components to generate alternative tactics. {ARTs} are found often where individuals invest heavily in reproduction in a way that can be circumvented and exploited by competitors, which reflects disruptive selection on reproductive investment. This often coincides with consistent size variation between individuals pursuing bourgeois and parasitic tactics.},

It is yet unclear why the occurrence of alternative reproductive tactics ({ARTs}) is highly divergent between major animal taxa. Here we aim to clarify the environmental and social conditions favouring the evolution of intra-population variance of male reproductive phenotypes. Our results suggest that genetically determined {ARTs} that are fixed for life evolve when there is strong selection on body size due to size-dependent competitiveness, in combination with environmental factors reducing size benefits. The latter may result from growth costs or, more generally, from age-dependent but size-independent mortality causes. This generates disruptive selection on growth trajectories underlying tactic choice. In many parameter settings, the model also predicts {ARTs} to evolve that are flexible and responsive to current conditions. Interestingly, the conditions favouring the evolution of flexible tactics diverge considerably from those favouring genetic variability. Nevertheless, in a restricted but relevant parameter space, our model predicts the simultaneous emergence and maintenance of a mixture of multiple tactics, both genetically and conditionally determined. Important conditions for the emergence of {ARTs} include size variation of competitors, which is inherently greater in species with indeterminate growth than in taxa reproducing only after reaching their terminal body size. This is probably the reason why {ARTs} are more common in fishes than in other major taxa.},

	abstract = {Polymorphism has fascinated evolutionary biologists since the time of Darwin. Biologists have observed discrete alternative mating strategies in many different species. In this study, we demonstrate that polymorphic mating strategies can emerge in a colony of hermaphrodite robots. We used a survival and reproduction task where the robots maintained their energy levels by capturing energy sources and physically exchanged genotypes for the reproduction of offspring. The reproductive success was dependent on the individuals' energy levels, which created a natural trade-off between the time invested in maintaining a high energy level and the time invested in attracting mating partners. We performed experiments in environments with different density of energy sources and observed a variety in the mating behavior when a robot could see both an energy source and a potential mating partner. The individuals could be classified into two phenotypes: 1) forager, who always chooses to capture energy sources, and 2) tracker, who keeps track of potential mating partners if its energy level is above a threshold. In four out of the seven highest fitness populations in different environments, we found subpopulations with distinct differences in genotype and in behavioral phenotype. We analyzed the fitnesses of the foragers and the trackers by sampling them from each subpopulation and mixing with different ratios in a population. The fitness curves for the two subpopulations crossed at about 25\% of foragers in the population, showing the evolutionary stability of the polymorphism. In one of those polymorphic populations, the trackers were further split into two subpopulations: (strong trackers) and (weak trackers). Our analyses show that the population consisting of three phenotypes also constituted several stable polymorphic evolutionarily stable states. To our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate the emergence of polymorphic evolutionarily stable strategies within a robot evolution framework.},

By defining the strategies and payoffs for habitat selection, this article puts the {IFD} concept in a more general game-theoretic setting of the “habitat selection game”. Within this game-theoretic framework, the article focuses on recent progress in the following directions: (1) studying evolutionarily stable dispersal rates and corresponding dispersal dynamics; (2) extending the concept when population numbers are not fixed but undergo population dynamics; (3) generalizing the {IFD} to multiple species. For a single species, the article briefly reviews existing results. It also develops a new perspective for Parker’s matching principle, showing that this can be viewed as the {IFD} of the habitat selection game that models consumer behavior in several resource patches and analyzing complications involved when the model includes resource dynamics as well. For two species, the article first demonstrates that the connection between {IFD} and {ESS} is now more delicate by pointing out pitfalls that arise when applying several existing game-theoretic approaches to these habitat selection games. However, by providing a new detailed analysis of dispersal dynamics for predator–prey or competitive interactions in two habitats, it also pinpoints one approach that shows much promise in this general setting, the so-called “two-species {ESS}”. The consequences of this concept are shown to be related to recent studies of population dynamics combined with individual dispersal and are explored for more species or more patches.},

Such habitat selection models have usually involved infinite well-mixed populations. In particular, the model of allocation over a number of food patches when movement is not costly, the ideal free distribution ({IFD}) model, is well developed. Here we generalize (and solve) a habitat selection game for a finite structured population. We show that habitat selection in such a structured population can have multiple stable solutions (in contrast to the equivalent {IFD} model where the solution is unique). We also define and study a “predator dilution game” where unlike in the habitat selection game, individuals prefer to aggregate (to avoid being caught by predators due to the dilution effect) and show that this model has a unique solution when movement is unrestricted.},

However, several different density-dependent habitat selection models exist in the literature incorporating many different scenarios. We attempt to unify some of these models in a single framework, to increase our predictive power, and assist researchers in making predictions from combinations of these models. To achieve this, we created the generalized ideal free distribution, an expansion of the ideal free distribution model. With this model, we synthesize many of the previous theoretical developments in habitat selection to better incorporate temporal dynamics. By using community matrices to represent the interaction between individuals, we demonstrated that thirteen scenarios represented in other studies can be combined into a single model. In addition, for four of these scenarios, our predictions are similar to the original studies that developed these scenarios. Additionally, we derived four novel predictions that take advantage of using community matrices to represent distribution. We discuss how this model creates a connection between community interactions and the distribution of individuals, and its uses in other subjects in ecology.},

	abstract = {"Preface: Since its inception in the 1960s, evolutionary game theory has become increasingly influential in the modelling of biology, both in terms of mathematical developments and especially in the range of applications. Important biological phenomena, such as the fact that the sex ratio of so many species is close to a half, the evolution of cooperative behaviour and the existence of costly ornaments like the peacock's tail, have been explained using ideas underpinned by game theoretical modelling. The key concept in biological games is the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy ({ESS}), which resists invasion by all others once it has achieved dominance in the population. This static concept is very powerful, and is the focus of analysis of the majority of models, and while we discuss numerous other mathematical concepts, this is the most important one for our book. For a number of years the authors have been aware that, while there are a number of good books on evolutionary games, a particular type of book that we were looking for did not exist. The catalyst for writing this book was a discussion between Nick Britton and {MB} on the subject of books in evolutionary game theory. Nick was looking for a book on this subject for the Taylor and Francis Mathematical and Computational Biology book series. After discussing this, the authors decided that this was an opportunity to write the book we had been looking for. The book that we were missing was a wide ranging book covering the major topics of evolutionary game theory, containing both the more abstract mathematical models and a range of mathematical models of real biological situations, and this is the book we have tried to write"--},

Small males with low intensity calls most frequently adopted the satellite tactic and preferred to parasitize the loudest callers. Because body size and call intensity were highly correlated with male mating success, small males with weak calls were at a reproductive disadvantage, and probably achieved greater success by exploiting the displays of larger, louder males than by calling themselves. The behaviour adopted by individual males in a given situation was predicted by a game theory model which assumed that males used an evolutionarily stable decision rule when choosing between alternative mating tactics. However, the model provided close agreement with observed behaviour only when it assumed that males have imperfect information about the behaviour of competitors. It is concluded that male toads adopt a conditional strategy which depends on their attractiveness to females. By switching between mating tactics appropriately, males maximized expected mating success within the constraint of the information available to them. The decision rule of the model qualitativelycorresponds to a proximate mechanism that males appeared to use when switching between tactics. The model offers insights into the behaviour of other species in which males display in groups to attract females.},

We used a simulation model to determine how frequency dependence, population density, and parasitoid ﬂies affect the mating success of calling and non-calling males. The simulation demonstrated that calling males have higher mating success than satellite males under most conditions, and the ﬁtness of both strategies increases with population density. Frequency-dependent selection did not have strong effects on calling or satellite male ﬁtness. However, if parasitoid ﬂies were present, satellite males had similar or higher mating success than calling males. These results demonstrate that the risk of parasitism strongly inﬂuences the ﬁtness of calling and satellite males and likely contributes to the continued coexistence of alternative reproductive behavior in crickets.},

In addition, models can become restrictive when they are viewed as archetypes, making us overgeneralize about the world and ignoring meaningful variation. The study of sexual conflict in insects illustrates some of the pitfalls of relying on Drosophila as a model system for sexual selection. Microbes can be used as models for populations and communities and are essential parts of larger biological systems.

Although much progress has been made, I contend that reliance on several common empirical and inferential approaches is limiting forward progress in key areas, which leads me to several suggestions. More studies should focus on revealing eco-evolutionary dynamics as they play out in the “real world,” as opposed to laboratories and mesocosms. At the community and ecosystem levels, increasing effort should be directed towards the importance of evolution acting through population density, as opposed to only direct per-capita effects. More work should be directed towards the effects of whole-community evolution, as opposed to the evolution of only particular focal species. New and innovative approaches are needed for studying how natural selection resists evolutionary and ecological change, thus generating cryptic eco-evolutionary dynamics. Although simultaneous improvement on all of these fronts is perhaps impossible for any single research programme, even advances in one or more areas could dramatically improve our understanding of the prevalence, power and relevance of eco-evolutionary dynamics.

	abstract = {A scientific understanding of the biological world arises when ideas about how nature works are formalized, tested, refined, and then tested again. Although the benefits of feedback between theoretical and empirical research are widely acknowledged by ecologists, this link is still not as strong as it could be in ecological research. This is in part because theory, particularly when expressed mathematically, can feel inaccessible to empiricists who may have little formal training in advanced math. To address this persistent barrier, we provide a general and accessible guide that covers the basic, step-by-step process of how to approach, understand, and use ecological theory in empirical work. We first give an overview of how and why mathematical theory is created, then outline four specific ways to use both mathematical and verbal theory to motivate empirical work, and finally present a practical tool kit for reading and understanding the mathematical aspects of ecological theory. We hope that empowering empiricists to embrace theory in their work will help move the field closer to a full integration of theoretical and empirical research.},

	abstract = {Males often compete for mates using alternative tactics whose relative success could be simultaneously influenced by four factors: subsequent behaviour, physiological state, the frequency of expression of alternative tactics and the density of competing males. Here the payoffs to two alternative male mating tactics (call and satellite) were examined in anurans using a stochastic dynamic game. The basic model considers an iteroparous species with a prolonged breeding season and fairly low energetic costs and predation risks. The model assumes that female chorus attendance is affected by weather, time of year and male chorusing intensity. Results show that interactions between energetic costs of calling, density-dependent predation risk and female arrival rates, and frequency-dependent mating success produce distinct temporal waves of male chorusing despite continuously favourable environmental conditions. Relative to second-year males, first-year males attended choruses less often and were more likely to become satellites. When the energetic costs of calling were increased, waves became shorter and less frequent, and some older calling males switched to satellite behaviour. Satellites were less common when breeding season length was constrained by extrinsic factors such as seasonal weather patterns. Extrinsic constraints may also affect system stability: if female arrival rates are independent of male chorusing intensity, an evolutionarily stable strategy occurs only if the breeding season is short. Even without extrinsic constraints, the breeding season may be short if predation rates on adults are sufficiently high, or if satellites intercept a large fraction of incoming females. Thus, the ‘explosive’ breeding systems observed in many anuran species could result from either biotic or abiotic causes.},

	abstract = {Intense sexual selection in the form of mate choice can facilitate the evolution of different alternative reproductive strategies, which can be condition-dependent. Tree cricket males produce long-distance acoustic signals which are used by conspecific females for mate localization and mate choice. Our study shows that baffling, an acoustic call amplification strategy employed by male tree crickets using self-made tools, is a classic example of a condition-dependent alternative strategy. We show that though most males can baffle, less preferred males, such as smaller and lower-amplitude callers, predominantly use this alternative strategy. Baffling allows these males to increase their call amplitude and advertisement range, which attracts a higher number of females. Baffling also gives these males a mating benefit because females mate for longer durations with them. Our results suggest that the advantage of baffling in terms of gain in the number of sperm cells transferred while mating is primarily limited to less preferred males, thus maintaining the polymorphism of calling strategies in the population. We summarize that baffling is a condition-dependent strategy used by less preferred tree cricket males to obtain mating benefits.},

	abstract = {Male reproductive success in systems exhibiting sexually selected traits can be driven by male mating effort in sexual signals and in the production of nuptial gifts. Male mating effort can be determined by various biotic and abiotic factors, such as nutritional quality, age, body size, mating status and temperature, contributing to the immediate condition of the male. Less preferred males in certain systems can also evolve condition-dependent alternate tactics to improve their reproductive fitness. In systems that involve long-distance acoustic signaling by males for mate attraction, in addition to male mating effort, female motivation to acoustically localize a potential mate can also impact male reproductive success. Female motivation can again be governed by female condition, depending upon nutritional status, age, size and mating status. 
Crickets of the order Orthoptera are excellent model systems to study all of the above. Males typically engage in energy-demanding long-distance acoustic signalling to attract conspecific females. Intraspecific variation in male investment in signalling and signal quality can be a key factor in determining the attractiveness of males to conspecific females and hence their reproductive fitness. Male mating effort in signalling can show condition-dependent trade-offs with other life history traits such as lifespan. Moreover, several orthopteran species also produce 
nuptial gifts that females feed on during mating. As most orthopterans are also polygamous, the replenishment time of nuptial meal and spermatophore can constrain the number of mating opportunities procured by males, thereby influencing their fitness. Male investment in number of matings and quality of nuptial gift can show condition-dependent variation. Although condition-dependent male investment in nuptial gifts and multiple matings has been the focus of many sexual selection studies, to the best of our knowledge, how various aspects of mating (re-mating propensity, latency to re-mate, investment in nuptial gift and male reproductive success) are modulated by male condition has not yet been investigated by following males across multiple matings. 
Therefore, in this thesis, I studied condition-dependent signalling and mating behaviour in an acoustically communicating tree cricket species, Oecanthus henryi in an attempt to elucidate the determinants of: a) male mating effort in signalling and mating, b) female responsiveness to signals and courtship, c) alternative signalling tactics in males (baffling) and d) male reproductive success (matings). 
In the first chapter, I studied the condition dependence of lifetime signaling of O. henryi by following individual males throughout their life in a semi-natural setup. Males reared on better quality adult diet had a higher lifetime and nightly signaling effort. Higher signaling effort implies better mate attraction potential. 
In the second chapter, I explored the condition-dependent male investment in nuptial feeding and corresponding reproductive success in terms of spermatophore attachment duration ({SPAD}). Nuptial feeding duration was found to be longer in males supplemented with highly nutritive diet. {SPAD} was affected by diet quality, age and male body size. Males on high-quality diet reaped 
more reproductive benefits with increasing age. Smaller males received the least reproductive benefit across age and diet. 
Oecanthus henryi males not only invest in energetically costly acoustic signals and nuptial gifts, but additionally exhibit a unique tool-making behavior called baffling, which confers them a reproductive advantage by increasing their signal loudness. In the third chapter, I investigated the condition-dependence of this signaling strategy and found that smaller males on better diet had higher baffling probability. This result suggests that baffling is an energetically expensive alternate tactic used by less-preferred males to improve their reproductive fitness. Nightly baffling propensity on a lifetime scale showed patterns of age-dependent decline. The senescence patterns of baffling did not differ significantly across dietary conditions. 
In the final chapter of my thesis, I aimed to understand the effect of female dietary condition and mating status on female mate search and mating behaviour. Interestingly, female mating status, and not diet, turned out to be a key driving factor in this context. Despite a high remating propensity, mated females showed significantly low motivation to perform phonotaxis. Besides, both nuptial feeding duration and spermatophore attachment duration decreased in mated females. Thus, for a male it is more advantageous to mate with an unmated female. This highlights the importance of the proportion of virgin females in a wild population for male reproductive success.},

	title = {Mate Choice, Mate Sampling And Baffling Behaviour In The Tree Cricket Oecanthus henryi},
	url = {https://etd.iisc.ac.in/handle/2005/2641},
	abstract = {Among the different sensory modalities that play a role in sexual selection, acoustic
communication plays an important one. Acoustic communication has been known to be
used for male-male competition (territory maintenance, male aggression during
mating),for advertisement to the opposite sex (mating status, body condition, genetic
quality, nutritional status) and used by females to sample and choose conspecific
preferred males. The use of acoustic communication for sexual display and information exchange has been extensively studied in multiple taxa, including insects, anurans, birds and mammals. Among insects, crickets have proven to be good model systems to study sexual selection based on acoustic communication as most species have an elaborate acoustic communication system, male advertisements, diverse types of
mating incentives for females (such as glandular feeding) and a female dominated
mating system. Generally, in crickets males produce species-specific calls which are
used by females to localize conspecific males. Besides, calls show high levels of
intraspecific variation and are energetically costly to produce. Moreover, as in crickets predominantly the females show phonotaxis towards male calls, calls also can play a role in mate sampling and choice by acting as indicators of preferred male quality.
Despite being studied for many decades there are certain gaps in the studies examining
mate choice in crickets. Some of them are, lack of understanding of the variation of
male calling traits in nature and its role in signal evolution, lack of understanding
regarding the ecological context of mate sampling and the evolution of alternative
mating strategies. Hence, the tree cricket Oecanthus henryi was chosen as a study
system to address these gaps in the understanding of female choice based on acoustic signals.
In the tree cricket Oecanthus henryi, males call and females use calls to localize
conspecific males and hence potentially females can choose males based on acoustic
cues. To understand the evolution of female preference for male acoustic cues it is
important to understand the variation in the calling songs in the field and identify
repeatable call features that are reliable indicators of preferred male traits
(morphological, developmental or genetic). I measured repeatability of male call traits in
the field to understand their variation, reliability and consistency. Carrier frequency was the only call trait that was highly repeatable and hence was reliable and consistent.
Following this I examined whether any of these call traits were indicators of male
morphological traits (such as male size and fluctuating asymmetry) which are known to
be preferred by females. It was found that carrier frequency was negatively correlated
with body size; hence carrier frequency was both reliable and indicated male size. I also
found that females preferred larger males during mating, as revealed by the longer
mating durations and longer spermatophore retention time. Interestingly, though this
study indicated that females could in principle use lower call carrier frequency to localize preferred larger males, simultaneous choice experiments done in the laboratory revealed that the females do not use this cue. These contrasting results may be because females are incapable of discriminating small differences in frequency or because they use non-acoustic cues for mate choice.
However, whichever cues the females use to discriminate between males in the
laboratory conditions, often these preferences are not realized in the field. The main reason behind this is that searching for preferred mates in the field can be costly and this might force females to choose sub-optimal males. Theoretical models predict that male movement and spacing in the field should influence female sampling tactics and in turn, females should drive the evolution of male movement and spacing to sample them optimally. Moreover, simultaneous sampling of males using the best-of-n or comparative Bayes strategy should yield maximum mating benefits to females. Many of the theoretical mate sampling strategies involves recall of the quality and location of individual males, which in turn requires male positions to be stable within a night.
Calling males of O. henryi showed high site fidelity within a night, potentially enabling
female sampling strategies that require recall. To examine the possibility of
simultaneous acoustic sampling of males, I estimated male acoustic active spaces
using information on male spacing, call transmission and female phonotactic threshold.
Males were found to be spaced far apart and active space overlap was rare. I then
examined female sampling scenarios by studying female spacing relative to male
acoustic active spaces. Only 15\% of sampled females could hear multiple males,
suggesting that simultaneous mate sampling is rare in the field. Moreover, the relatively large distances between calling males suggest high search costs, which may favor threshold strategies that do not require memory.
Using the insights gathered from these two studies I examined a unique calling
behaviour from leaf holes, baffling, observed in this species. Baffling behaviour has been found in multiple species of the genus Oecanthus where the males call from selfmade holes in leaves rather than calling from leaf edges (their natural calling surface) thus increasing their loudness many fold. I started by examining the natural history of baffling and found that baffling is an extremely rare behaviour in the field. However field observations and laboratory experiments revealed that many males can baffle and hence it is not an obligatory behaviour shown only by a few males. It was hypothesized that one reason for the rarity of baffling could be resource limitation. It was found that baffling males prefer larger leaves possibly due to higher {SPL} gains achieved by baffling on the larger leaves, which is a limited resource in the field. However this alone was insufficient to explain extreme rarity of bafflers in the field. Hence I examined which males were using this behaviour in the field. Using field observations and laboratory
experiments it was found that less preferred males (smaller and quieter) baffled more
which provided them with higher calling {SPL} and greater sound-field volume and thus a
higher number of potential mates. Moreover, baffling also increased the mating
duration for the less preferred males thus providing more time to these males for sperm
transfer. The females could not differentiate between an inherently loud caller and a caller whose {SPL} was increased artificially (as if it was baffling). Hence I concluded that baffling is probably a cheater strategy used by the less preferred males to fool the females into approaching them and mating for longer durations.
To my knowledge, this is the first study that has estimated male call variation in the field to understand its role in female choice in tree crickets. Moreover this is also the first study to examine the ecological context of mate choice in tree crickets. This is also the first study to examine the advantages of baffling behaviour and its potential evolutionary implications.

	abstract = {Oncorhynchus mykiss exhibit high plasticity in their life history patterns. Individual life history decisions are hypothesized to result from genetic thresholds shaped by local adaptation, with variation in environmental factors influencing the trajectories of growth and condition (e.g., Fulton's K, lipid content). We compared growth rates and life history patterns in two coastal creeks (Scott and Soquel) and two Central Valley ({CV}) rivers (American and Mokelumne) in California. The two regions differed markedly in habitat and physical factors, including hydrograph timing and amplitude, temperature regime, and food availability (measured as drift). Growth rates of coastal age-0 fish averaged 0.1 mm/d in summer–fall and 0.2 mm/d in winter–spring. Growth rates of {CV} fish were up to 10 times faster than those of fish on the coast and had the opposite seasonal pattern, in which growth in summer–fall was faster than that in winter–spring. Fish growth also differed between {CV} rivers; the mean growth rates were 1.0 mm/d in summer–fall and 0.7 mm/d in winter–spring among American River fish and 0.7 mm/d in summer–fall and 0.5 mm/d in winter–spring among Mokelumne River fish. The life history expression and age structures of O. mykiss in the coastal creeks were similar, with populations being dominated by age-0 fish but including mature residents up to age 6. The two {CV} populations were strikingly different in life history expression. In the American River, a single cohort was present and nearly all fish emigrated in the spring following their birth year. In the Mokelumne River, a broad diversity of ages (up to 4 years) was present, with a large proportion of presumed residents. The observed variation in life histories aligned with predictions based on state-dependent life history models developed for the four streams, further demonstrating the adaptability of O. mykiss to contrasting rearing environments.

	abstract = {That sexually mature fish skip reproduction, especially in response to poor condition, has been documented in many species. We present results from an energy-allocation life history model that shed light on the underlying logic of skipped spawning, based on the Northeast Arctic stock of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). The model predicts that skipped spawning is a regular phenomenon, with up to 30\% of the sexually mature biomass skipping spawning. Spawning should be skipped if the expected future gain in reproductive output, discounted by survival, more than balances the expected reproductive success the current year. Skipped spawning was most common (i) among potential second-time spawners and (ii) early in life, (iii) when fishing mortality at the spawning grounds was high, (iv) when fishing mortality at the feeding grounds was low, (v) when natural mortality was low, and (vi) when the energetic and mortality costs associated with migration and spawning were high. Cod skipped spawning more often when food availability was both increased (opportunities for better growth) and decreased (too little energy for gonad development), and this pattern interacted with mortality rate. We conclude that skipped spawning may be more widespread than appreciated and highlight potential consequences for the understanding of stockrecruitment relationships.},

Whenever the payoff function of the game that describes the simultaneous interaction of the individuals in the population, and thereby determines their fitnesses, is sufficiently continuous, an evolutionarily stable strategy ({ESS}) in a large population corresponds to a symmetric Nash equilibrium in that game, and a strict, symmetric Nash equilibrium in that game corresponds to a large-population {ESS}. This correspondence continues to hold, approximately, in finite populations; and it holds exactly for strict pure-strategy equilibria in sufficiently large finite populations. /// L'article étudie la correspondance entre équilibre de Nash et stabilité évolutionnaire dans des populations grandes et finies.

	abstract = {This paper considers a hunting game in the “playing the field” model, in which an individual within a group has to choose from two survival strategies: the group hunting strategy or the individual hunting strategy. The group hunting strategy aims at hunting more dangerous, larger prey, that are far beyond a single individual’s capture ability, where the return is greater but the risk is higher. While the individual hunting strategy aims at hunting small prey that can be easily captured by an independent individual, where the return is less but the risk is lower. Evolutionary game theory is used to investigate the selection dynamics of a two-strategy game with a finite population. This reveals the existences of the stable/unstable equilibrium points and evolutionarily stable strategies when there is the frequency-dependent strategy selection in the hunting game. The evolutionarily stable state is found to be not always unique because the system of the hunting game can have multiple equilibrium points. It is shown that a stable equilibrium point will always act as an evolutionarily stable strategy, while an unstable equilibrium point cannot resist invasion from a mutation. The population fitness cannot always reach the optimum level when applying the evolutionary process with the fitness difference function.},

	abstract = {In this article, we develop population game theory, a theory that combines the dynamics of animal behavior with population dynamics. In particular, we study interaction and distribution of two species in a two‐patch environment assuming that individuals behave adaptively (i.e., they maximize Darwinian fitness). Either the two species are competing for resources or they are in a predator‐prey relationship. Using some recent advances in evolutionary game theory, we extend the classical ideal free distribution ({IFD}) concept for single species to two interacting species. We study population dynamical consequences of two‐species {IFD} by comparing two systems: one where individuals cannot migrate between habitats and one where migration is possible. For single species, predator‐prey interactions, and competing species, we show that these two types of behavior lead to the same population equilibria and corresponding species spatial distributions, provided interspecific competition is patch independent. However, if differences between patches are such that competition is patch dependent, then our predictions strongly depend on whether animals can migrate or not. In particular, we show that when species are settled at their equilibrium population densities in both habitats in the environment where migration between habitats is blocked, then the corresponding species spatial distribution need not be an {IFD}. Thus, when species are given the opportunity to migrate, they will redistribute to reach an {IFD} (e.g., under which the two species can completely segregate), and this redistribution will also influence species population equilibrial densities. Alternatively, we also show that when two species are distributed according to the {IFD}, the corresponding population equilibrium can be unstable.},

Conditional trimorphisms have recently been unveiled, and here we combine the rock-paper-scissors ({RPS}) model of game theory and the environmental threshold ({ET}) model of quantitative genetics to model trimorphisms that are environmentally induced and result from the expression of two thresholds. We investigated the tactic ﬁtness structure for maintenance of alternative reproductive tactics in scarab dung beetles that constitute the ﬁrst known examples of conditional male trimorphism. We parameterized a novel ternary ﬁtness landscape that explains how conditional male trimorphism in these beetles can be maintained. We tracked changes in tactic frequencies in a wild population of Phanaeus triangularis and detected ﬁtness intransitivity consistent with {RPS} dynamics. Quantitative predictions of our model compare favorably with corresponding observed parameters. The ternary landscape further reveals how geographic populations of these beetles can evolve between conditional trimorphism and dimorphism. The ternary model also suggests that polyphenic systems could potentially evolve between conditional and purely genetic mediation.},

In the conventional fundamental matrix method, quantities like fixation probability and fixation time are calculable. Using a theorem in the fundamental matrix method, conditional fixation time in the absorbing Markov chain is calculable. Also, in the ergodic Markov chain, the stationary probability distribution that describes the Markov chain’s stationary state is calculable analytically. Finally, the Rock, scissor, paper evolutionary game are evaluated as an example, and the results of the analytical method and simulations are compared.

	shorttitle = {Male alternative reproductive tactics and sperm competition},
	abstract = {In many animal species, males may exhibit one of several discrete, alternative ways of obtaining fertilisations, known as alternative reproductive tactics ({ARTs}). Males exhibiting {ARTs} typically differ in the extent to which they invest in traits that improve their mating success, or the extent to which they face sperm competition. This has led to the widespread prediction that males exhibiting {ARTs} associated with a high sperm competition risk, or lower investment into traits that improve their competitiveness before mating, should invest more heavily into traits that improve their competitiveness after mating, such as large ejaculates and high-quality sperm. However, despite many studies investigating this question since the 1990s, evidence for differences in sperm and ejaculate investment between male {ARTs} is mixed, and there has been no quantitative summary of this field. Following a systematic review of the literature, we performed a meta-analysis examining how testes size, sperm number and sperm traits differ between males exhibiting {ARTs} that face either a high or low sperm competition risk, or high or low investment in traits that increase mating success. We obtained data from 92 studies and 67 species from across the animal kingdom. Our analyses showed that male fish exhibiting {ARTs} facing a high sperm competition risk had significantly larger testes (after controlling for body size) than those exhibiting tactics facing a low sperm competition risk. However, this effect appears to be due to the inappropriate use of the gonadosomatic index as a body-size corrected measure of testes investment, which overestimates the difference in testes investment between male tactics in most cases. We found no significant difference in sperm number between males exhibiting different {ARTs}, regardless of whether sperm were measured from the male sperm stores or following ejaculation. We also found no significant difference in sperm traits between males exhibiting different {ARTs}, with the exception of sperm adenosine triphosphate ({ATP}) content in fish. Finally, the difference in post-mating investment between male {ARTs} was not influenced by the extent to which tactics were flexible, or by the frequency of sneakers in the population. Overall, our results suggest that, despite clear theoretical predictions, there is little evidence that male {ARTs} differ substantially in investment into sperm and ejaculates across species. The incongruence between theoretical and empirical results could be explained if (i) theoretical models fail to account for differences in overall resource levels between males exhibiting different {ARTs} or fundamental trade-offs between investment into different ejaculate and sperm traits, and (ii) studies often use sperm or ejaculate traits that do not reflect overall post-mating investment accurately or affect fertilisation success.},

In contrast to previous analytical approaches which primarily focus on computing the expected number of internal equilibria, in this paper we study the distribution of the number of internal equilibria in a multi-player two-strategy random evolutionary game. We derive for the first time a closed formula for the probability that the game has a certain number of internal equilibria, for both normal and uniform distributions of the game payoff entries. In addition, using Descartes’ rule of signs and combinatorial methods, we provide several universal upper and lower bound estimates for this probability, which are independent of the underlying payoff distribution. We also compare our analytical results with those obtained from extensive numerical simulations. Many results of this paper are applicable to a wider class of random polynomials that are not necessarily from evolutionary games.},

If a matrix game has an {ESS} which allows all possible pure strategies to be played, referred to as an internal {ESS}, then no other {ESS} can exist. In fact, the number of {ESSs} possible is highly dependent upon how many of the pure strategies each allow to be played, their support size. It is shown that if α is the ratio of the mean support size to the number of pure strategies n, then as n tends to infinity the greatest number of {ESSs} can be represented by a continuous function f(α) with useful regularity properties, and bounds are found for both f(α) and the value α∗, where it attains its maximum.

	abstract = {In an unpredictably changing environment, phenotypic variability may evolve as a “bet-hedging” strategy. We examine here two models for evolutionarily stable phenotype distributions resulting from stabilizing selection with a randomly fluctuating optimum. Both models include overlapping generations, either survival of adults or a dormant propagule pool. In the first model (mixed-strategies model) we assume that individuals can produce offspring with a distribution of phenotypes, in which case, the evolutionarily stable population always consists of a single genotype. We show that there is a unique evolutionarily stable strategy ({ESS}) distribution that does not depend on the amount of generational overlap, and that the {ESS} distribution generically is discrete rather than continuous; that is, there are distinct classes of offspring rather than a continuous distribution of offspring phenotypes. If the probability of extreme fluctuations in the optimum is sufficiently small, then the {ESS} distribution is monomorphic: a single type fitted to the mean environment. At higher levels of variability, the {ESS} distribution is polymorphic, and we find stability conditions for dimorphic distributions. For an exponential or similarly broad-tailed distribution of the optimum phenotype, the {ESS} consists of an infinite number of distinct phenotypes.

The {ESS} population then contains multiple genotypes when the environmental variance is sufficiently high. However the phenotype distributions are similar to those in the mixed-strategies model: discrete, with an increasing number of distinct phenotypes as the environmental variance increases.},

Many of the evolutionary, ecological, and genetic mechanisms producing and maintaining resource polymorphisms are similar among phylogenetically distinct species. Although further studies are needed, the genetic basis may be simple, in some cases under the control of a single locus, with phenotypic plasticity playing a proximate role in some taxa. Divergent selection including either directional, disruptive, or frequency-dependent selection is important in their evolution. Generally, the invasion of “open” niches or underutilized resources requiring unique trophic characters and decreased interspecific competition have promoted the evolution of resource polymorphisms. Further investigations centered on their role in speciation, especially adaptive radiation, are likely to be fruitful.},

Larvae of New Mexico spadefoot toads (Scaphiopus multiplicatus) often occur in the same pond as a large, rapidly developing carnivorous morph and as a smaller, more slowly developing omnivorous morph. Previous studies revealed that carnivores can be induced by feeding tadpoles live fairy shrimp and that morph determination is reversible. Field and laboratory experiments indicated that the ability of an individual to become a carnivore or an omnivore is maintained evolutionarily as a response to variability in pond longevity and food abundance. Carnivores survived better in highly ephemeral artificial ponds, because they developed faster. Omnivores survived better in longer-duration artificial ponds, because their larger fat reserves enhanced postmetamorphic survival. The two morphs also occupy different trophic niches. Experimental manipulations of morph frequency in ponds of intermediate duration revealed that increased competition for food among individuals of the more common morph made the rarer form more successful. Morph frequency within each pond was stabilized at an equilibrium by frequency-dependent morph reversal, which reflected frequency-dependent natural selection on size at metamorphosis: larger metamorphs had higher survival, and individuals reared at a frequency above the pond's equilibrium frequency were smaller at metamorphosis than were individuals of that morph reared at a frequency below the pond's equilibrium. Because neighboring ponds often differed in pond longevity and food abundance, each pond possessed a unique equilibrium morph frequency. This implies that morph determination in Scaphiopus is a locally adjusted evolutionarily stable strategy ({ESS}).},

Under selection, a variety of mechanisms may be involved in the maintenance of polymorphisms, for example, sexual selection or host-parasite coevolution on the population level or heterozygote advantage in diploid individuals. Here we address the emergence of polymorphisms in a population of interacting haploid individuals. In our model, each mutation generates a new evolutionary game characterized by a payoff matrix with an additional row and an additional column. Hence, in general, the fitness of new mutations is frequency-dependent rather than constant. This dynamical process is distinct from the sequential fixation of advantageous traits and naturally leads to the emergence of polymorphisms under selection. It causes substantially higher diversity than observed under the established models of neutral or frequency-independent selection. Our framework allows for the coexistence of an arbitrary number of types, but predicts an intermediate average diversity.},

There are many kinds of phenotypic polymorphisms, with specialization in reproduction, feeding, dispersal, or protection from predators. An individual’s phenotype might be randomly assigned during development, genetically determined, or set by environmental cues. These three possibilities correspond to a mixed strategy of development, a genetic polymorphism, and a conditional strategy. Using the perspective of adaptive dynamics, I develop a unifying evolutionary theory of systems of determination of alternative phenotypes, focusing on the relative possibilities for random versus genetic determination. The approach is an extension of the analysis of evolutionary branching in adaptive dynamics. It compares the possibility that there will be evolutionary branching, leading to genetic polymorphism, with the possibility that a mixed strategy evolves. The comparison is based on the strength of selection for the different outcomes. An interpretation of the resulting criterion is that genetic polymorphism is favored over random determination of the phenotype if an individual’s heritable genotype is an adaptively advantageous cue for development. I argue that it can be helpful to regard genetic polymorphism as a special case of phenotypic plasticity.},

The sharing of public goods depends on their diffusion through space. Previous theory suggests that spatial structure can promote evolution of cooperation, but the diffusion of public goods introduces new phenomena that must be modeled explicitly. We develop an approach where colony geometry and public good diffusion are described by graphs. We find that the success of cooperation depends on a simple relation between the benefits and costs of the public good, the amount retained by a producer, and the average amount retained by each of the producer’s neighbors. These quantities are derived as analytic functions of the graph topology and diffusion rate. In general, cooperation is favored for small diffusion rates, low colony dimensionality, and small rates of decay of the public good.},

	abstract = {Polymorphic warning signals in aposematic species are enigmatic because predator learning and discrimination should select for the most common coloration, resulting in positive frequency-dependent survival selection. Here, we investigated whether differential mating success could create sufficiently strong negative frequency-dependent selection for rare morphs to explain polymorphic (white and yellow) warning coloration in male wood tiger moths (Parasemia plantaginis). We conducted an experiment in semi-natural conditions where we estimated mating success for both white and yellow male moths under three different morph frequencies. Contrary to expectations, mating success was positively frequency-dependent: white morph males had high relative fitness when common, likewise yellow morph males had high relative fitness when instead they were common. We hence built a model parameterized with our data to examine whether polymorphism can be maintained despite two sources of positive frequency dependence. The model includes known spatial variation in the survival advantage enjoyed by the yellow morph and assumes that relative mating success follows our experimentally derived values. It predicts that polymorphism is possible under migration for up to approximately 20\% exchange of individuals between subpopulations in each generation. Our results suggest that differential mating success combined with spatial variation in predator communities may operate as a selection mosaic that prevents complete fixation of either morph.},

The maximal number of equilibria and their classification based on stability have been the primary subjects of these studies, for example in the context of two-player games with multiple strategies. Herein, we address a different question using evolutionary game theory as a tool. If the payoff matrices are drawn randomly from an arbitrary distribution, what are the probabilities of observing a certain number of (stable) equilibria? We extend the domain of previous results for the two-player framework, which corresponds to a single diploid locus in population genetics, by addressing the full complexity of multi-player games with multiple strategies. In closing, we discuss an application and illustrate how previous results on the number of equilibria, such as the famous Feldman–Karlin conjecture on the maximal number of isolated fixed points in a viability selection model, can be obtained as special cases of our results based on multi-player evolutionary games. We also show how the probability of realizing a certain number of equilibria changes as we increase the number of players and number of strategies.},

	abstract = {We extend our exploration of the dynamics of spatial evolutionary games [Nowak \& May 1992, 1993] in three distinct but related ways. We analyse, first, deterministic versus stochastic rules; second, discrete versus continuous time (see Hubermann \& Glance [1993]); and, third, different geometries of interaction in regular and random spatial arrays. We show that spatial effects can change some of the intuitive concepts in evolutionary game theory: (i) equilibria among strategies are no longer necessarily characterised by equal average payoffs; (ii) the strategy with the higher average payoff can steadily converge towards extinction; (iii) strategies can become extinct even though their basic reproductive rate (at very low frequencies) is larger than one. The equilibrium properties of spatial games are instead determined by “local relative payoffs.”

We characterise the conditions for coexistence between cooperators and defectors in the spatial prisoner’s dilemma game. We find that cooperation can be maintained if the transition rules give more weight to the most successful neighbours, or if there is a certain probability that cells may remain unoccupied in the next generations when they are surrounded by players with low payoffs. In this second case the cooperators can survive despite a very large payoff advantage to defectors. We also compute average extinction times for random drift in neutral spatial models. Finally we briefly describe the spatial dynamics of an interaction among three species which dominate each other in a cyclic fashion. The emphasis of this paper is presenting a variety of ideas and possibilities for further research in the evolutionary dynamics of spatial games. The overall conclusion is that interactions with local neighbours in 2- or 3-dimensional spatial arrays can promote coexistence of different strategies (such as cooperators and defectors in the Prisoner’s Dilemma), in situations where one strategy would exclude all others if the interactions occurred randomly and homogeneously.},

	abstract = {For nearly three decades, spatial games have produced a wealth of insights to the study of behavior and its relation to population structure. However, as different rules and factors are added or altered, the dynamics of spatial models often become increasingly complicated to interpret. To tackle this problem, we introduce persistent homology as a rigorous framework that can be used to both define and compute higher-order features of data in a manner which is invariant to parameter choices, robust to noise, and independent of human observation. Our work demonstrates its relevance for spatial games by showing how topological features of simulation data that persist over different spatial scales reflect the stability of strategies in 2D lattice games. To do so, we analyze the persistent homology of scenarios from two games: a Prisoner’s Dilemma and a {SIRS} epidemic model. The experimental results show how the method accurately detects features that correspond to real aspects of the game dynamics. Unlike other tools that study dynamics of spatial systems, persistent homology can tell us something meaningful about population structure while remaining neutral about the underlying structure itself. Regardless of game complexity, since strategies either succeed or fail to conform to shapes of a certain topology there is much potential for the method to provide novel insights for a wide variety of spatially extended systems in biology, social science, and physics.},

Evolutionary game theory2,3 has become a powerful framework with which to investigate this problem. Two simple games have attracted most attention in theoretical and experimental studies: the Prisoner's Dilemma4 and the snowdrift game (also known as the hawk–dove or chicken game)5. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, the non-cooperative state is evolutionarily stable, which has inspired numerous investigations of suitable extensions that enable cooperative behaviour to persist. In particular, on the basis of spatial extensions of the Prisoner's Dilemma, it is widely accepted that spatial structure promotes the evolution of cooperation6,7,8. Here we show that no such general predictions can be made for the effects of spatial structure in the snowdrift game. In unstructured snowdrift games, intermediate levels of cooperation persist. Unexpectedly, spatial structure reduces the proportion of cooperators for a wide range of parameters. In particular, spatial structure eliminates cooperation if the cost-to-benefit ratio of cooperation is high. Our results caution against the common belief that spatial structure is necessarily beneficial for cooperative behaviour.},

We empirically examined this prediction for the size polymorphism of the swordtail Xiphophorus nigrensis, in which a single locus on the Y chromosome controls male size. Small males mature earlier and chase females, whereas large males mature later and court females. We analyze our data with a model that uses the differential mating success and the ages at sexual maturity of the two morphs to calculate the per capita death rate necessary for them to have equal fitness. We demonstrate how female fecundity data can be used to determine whether the estimated death rate is biologically realistic. Our data support the hypothesis that morph fitnesses are equal, and the model is fairly robust to changes in population growth rate and differential death rates of morphs. However, the confidence intervals for our estimates are large, which suggests that the null hypothesis only be accepted with caution. We show that in many circumstances very large sample sizes will be needed to distinguish between alternative hypotheses concerning the relative fitnesses of the two morphs. We emphasize that despite the popularity of alternative mating behaviors, specifically, and mixed evolutionarily stable strategies, in general, there is almost no empirical evidence that alternative behavioral morphs have equal fitnesses. Also, the conclusion that morph fitnesses are equal does not address the hypothesis that frequency-dependent mating success is the mechanism maintaining the equilibrium of fitnesses. This requires additional evidence directly demonstrating the fitness effect of changes in morph frequency.},

This type of evolutionary dynamics occurs in many settings of ecology, infectious disease dynamics, animal behavior and social interactions of humans. Traditionally evolutionary game dynamics are studied in well-mixed populations, where the interaction between any two individuals is equally likely. There have also been several approaches to study evolutionary games in structured populations. In this paper we present a simple result that holds for a large variety of population structures. We consider the game between two strategies, A and B, described by the payoff matrix (acbd). We study a mutation and selection process. For weak selection strategy A is favored over B if and only if σa+b{\textgreater}c+σd. This means the effect of population structure on strategy selection can be described by a single parameter, σ. We present the values of σ for various examples including the well-mixed population, games on graphs, games in phenotype space and games on sets. We give a proof for the existence of such a σ, which holds for all population structures and update rules that have certain (natural) properties. We assume weak selection, but allow any mutation rate. We discuss the relationship between σ and the critical benefit to cost ratio for the evolution of cooperation. The single parameter, σ, allows us to quantify the ability of a population structure to promote the evolution of cooperation or to choose efficient equilibria in coordination games.},

	abstract = {Biological processes, such as embryonic development, wound repair and cancer invasion, or bacterial swarming and fruiting body formation, involve collective motion of cells as a coordinated group. Collective cell motion of eukaryotic cells often includes interactions that result in polar alignment of cell velocities, while bacterial patterns typically show features of apolar velocity alignment. For analysing the population-scale effects of these different alignment mechanisms, various on- and off-lattice agent-based models have been introduced. However, discriminating model-specific artefacts from general features of collective cell motion is challenging. In this work, we focus on equivalence criteria at the population level to compare on- and off-lattice models. In particular, we define prototypic off- and on-lattice models of polar and apolar alignment, and show how to obtain an on-lattice from an off-lattice model of velocity alignment. By characterizing the behaviour and dynamical description of collective migration models at the macroscopic level, we suggest the type of phase transitions and possible patterns in the approximative macroscopic partial differential equation descriptions as informative equivalence criteria between on- and off-lattice models.

	abstract = {Ecological systems are complex assemblies of large numbers of individuals, interacting competitively under multifaceted environmental conditions. Recent studies using microbial laboratory communities have revealed some of the self-organization principles underneath the complexity of these systems. A major role of the inherent stochasticity of its dynamics and the spatial segregation of different interacting species into distinct patterns has thereby been established. It ensures the viability of microbial colonies by allowing for species diversity, cooperative behavior and other kinds of “social” behavior. A synthesis of evolutionary game theory, nonlinear dynamics, and the theory of stochastic processes provides the mathematical tools and a conceptual framework for a deeper understanding of these ecological systems. We give an introduction into the modern formulation of these theories and illustrate their effectiveness focussing on selected examples of microbial systems. Intrinsic fluctuations, stemming from the discreteness of individuals, are ubiquitous, and can have an important impact on the stability of ecosystems. In the absence of speciation, extinction of species is unavoidable. It may, however, take very long times. We provide a general concept for defining survival and extinction on ecological time-scales. Spatial degrees of freedom come with a certain mobility of individuals. When the latter is sufficiently high, bacterial community structures can be understood through mapping individual-based models, in a continuum approach, onto stochastic partial differential equations. These allow progress using methods of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcation analysis and invariant manifolds. We conclude with a perspective on the current challenges in quantifying bacterial pattern formation, and how this might have an impact on fundamental research in non-equilibrium physics.},

Previous research has shown, for example, that cooperative behaviors disfavored in well-mixed populations can be favored when interactions occur only between spatial neighbors or group members. Combining the adaptive dynamics approach with recent advances in evolutionary game theory, we here introduce a general mathematical framework for analyzing the long-term evolution of continuous game strategies for a broad class of evolutionary models, encompassing many varieties of interaction structure. Our main result, the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics with interaction structure, characterizes expected evolutionary trajectories resulting from any such model, thereby generalizing a central tool of adaptive dynamics theory. Interestingly, the effects of different interaction structures and update rules on evolutionary trajectories are fully captured by just two real numbers associated with each model, which are independent of the considered game. The first, a structure coefficient, quantifies the effects on selection pressures and thus on the shapes of expected evolutionary trajectories. The second, an effective population size, quantifies the effects on selection responses and thus on the expected rates of adaptation. Applying our results to two social dilemmas, we show how the range of evolutionarily stable cooperative behaviors systematically varies with a model’s structure coefficient.},

The interaction operator is not assumed to be linear. We investigate a Lotka-Volterra competition model with a linear interaction operator of convolution type separately because the convolution operator is not compact. For this model, we exclude the possibility of robust coexistence supported on the whole real line, or even on a set containing a limit point. Moreover, we exclude coexistence of an infinite set of equidistant strategies when the total population size is finite. On the other hand, for infinite populations it is possible to have robust coexistence in this case. These results are in line with the ecological concept of “limiting similarity” of coexisting species.

An increase in available niche space, provision of refuges and opportunities for isolation and divergent adaptation are thought to enhance species coexistence, persistence and diversification.

Apart from widespread evidence supporting positive relationships, negative and hump-shaped relationships have also been reported. In a meta-analysis of 1148 data points from 192 studies worldwide, we examine the strength and direction of the relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species richness of terrestrial plants and animals. We find that separate effects of heterogeneity in land cover, vegetation, climate, soil and topography are significantly positive, with vegetation and topographic heterogeneity showing particularly strong associations with species richness. The use of equal-area study units, spatial grain and spatial extent emerge as key factors influencing the strength of heterogeneity–richness relationships, highlighting the pervasive influence of spatial scale in heterogeneity–richness studies. We provide the first quantitative support for the generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships across heterogeneity components, habitat types, taxa and spatial scales from landscape to global extents, and identify specific needs for future comparative heterogeneity–richness research.},

Both environmental gradients and spatial landscape structure have been found to be important factors influencing species distributions and community composition, and partly reflect the balance of underlying deterministic and stochastic community processes. In some systems, environmental gradients and spatial connectivity are intertwined in that steep environmental gradients serve as boundaries on species movements and impose environment-derived complex spatial structure to metacommunities. Mountainous landscapes are prime examples of this, and recent theory has linked principles of geomorphology, environmental gradients, and spatial structure to make predictions for resulting community patterns. In this context, we examine variation in taxonomic and phylogenetic ant diversity patterns along a geographic transect spanning {\textgreater} 5000 m in elevational range in the Hengduan mountains of southern China. We found that environmental gradients dominate variation in both alpha and beta diversity in this landscape, with alpha diversity strongly declining with elevation and beta diversity driven by elevational differences. However, within an elevational band spatial connectivity predicts beta diversity better than geographic distance. Our findings deviate from theoretical predictions in several ways, notably alpha diversity is monotonically declining and within-band beta diversity is invariant with increasing elevation. The discrepancies between theory and observation may be explained by differences in the Hengduan landscape from idealized fluvial landscapes, such as a lack of a mid-elevation peak in connectivity, as well as evolutionary limits on the source pool of species available to populate metacommunities at different elevations. The latter is supported by variation in phylogenetic community structure with elevation. Our results demonstrate the power of conceptual, statistical, and theoretical frameworks that integrate the roles of environment and spatial structure in metacommunities, but that additional work is needed to bridge the gap between abstract theory and real systems.},

We examine the evolutionary equilibrium under general conditions where demography and selection may be nonsymmetric between the two habitats.

Using the stationary distribution of the population’s trait variance, we identify three qualitatively different sub-domains of “stochastic branching” and illustrate our results using a model of social evolution. We find that in very small populations, branching will almost never be observed; in intermediate populations, branching is intermittent, arising and disappearing over time; in larger populations, finally, branching is expected to occur and persist for substantial periods of time. Our study provides a clearer picture of the ecological conditions that facilitate the appearance and persistence of novel evolutionary lineages in the face of genetic drift.},

Large populations are predicted to undergo rapid evolutionary branching; however, in small populations, the waiting time to branching increases steeply with decreasing abundance, and below a critical size, the population remains monomorphic indefinitely. Here, we (1) extend the theory to sexual populations and (2) confront its predictions with empirical data, testing statistically whether lake size affects the level of resource polymorphism in arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) in 22 lakes of different sizes. For a given level of recombination, our model predicts qualitatively similar relations between population size and time to evolutionary branching (either speciation or evolution of genetic polymorphism) as the asexual model, while recombination further increases the delay to branching. The loss of polymorphism at certain loci, an inherent aspect of multilocus‐trait evolution, may increase the delay to speciation, resulting in stable genetic polymorphism without speciation. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the occurrence of resource polymorphism depends on both lake size and the number of coexisting fish species. For a given number of coexisting species, the level of polymorphism increases significantly with lake size, thus confirming our model prediction.},

Here, we study the effect of stochasticity caused by the finiteness of the population size on evolutionary branching. By analyzing the dynamics of trait variance, we obtain the condition for evolutionary branching as the one under which trait variance explodes. Genetic drift reduces the trait variance and causes stochastic fluctuation. In a very small population, evolutionary branching does not occur. In larger populations, evolutionary branching may occur, but it occurs in two different manners: in deterministic branching, branching occurs quickly when the population reaches the singular point, while in stochastic branching, the population stays at singularity for a period before branching out. The conditions for these cases and the mean branching-out times are calculated in terms of population size, mutational effects, and selection intensity and are confirmed by direct computer simulations of the individual-based model.},

It has been shown that for a general class of competition models, gradual evolutionary change in continuous phenotypes (evolutionary dynamics) can be nonstationary and even chaotic when the dimension of the phenotype space in which the evolutionary dynamics unfold is high. It has also been shown that evolutionary diversification can occur along nonequilibrium trajectories in phenotype space. We combine these lines of thinking by studying long-term coevolutionary dynamics of emerging lineages in multidimensional phenotype spaces. We use a statistical approach to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of many different systems. We find (1) that, for a given dimension of phenotype space, the coevolutionary dynamics tend to be fast and nonstationary for an intermediate number of coexisting lineages but tend to stabilize as the evolving communities reach a saturation level of diversity and (2) that the amount of diversity at the saturation level increases rapidly (exponentially) with the dimension of phenotype space. These results have implications for theoretical perspectives on major macroevolutionary patterns such as adaptive radiation, long-term temporal patterns of phenotypic changes, and the evolution of diversity.},

Yet suites of behaviours linked with reproduction can also favour habitat segregation and exploitation of different prey among morphs. By contrast, trophic polymorphisms are usually attributed to morphs exhibiting habitat or prey selectivity. An alternative hypothesis is that habitat variation generates a trophic polymorphism driven by differences in morph reproductive behaviour, the spatial dispersion of morphs in a landscape and their exposure to different prey types. In this scenario, morphs are allowed to vary in habitat or diet selectivity (e.g. specialist or generalist) as they do in behaviour, rather than being assumed to exhibit equivalent levels of ecological specialization. We test this hypothesis using male Urosaurus ornatus lizards that exhibit a discrete dewlap colour polymorphism that reflects alternative mating tactics. We found blue morphs specialize on prey at higher trophic levels, yellow males display plasticity in trophic and morphological attributes and orange males are trophic generalists. Our results also demonstrate that morph diet differences are enhanced in resource-limited habitats. We conclude that discrete behavioural morphs may also diverge in morphology and trophic niche. Jointly, these processes may enhance speciation rates in colour polymorphic taxa.},

This balance may be maintained through trade-offs where migrants gain survival benefits by avoiding unfavourable conditions, while residents gain breeding benefits from early access to resources. There has been little overarching quantitative analysis of the evidence for this fitness balance. As migrants—especially long-distance migrants—may be particularly vulnerable to environmental change, it is possible that recent anthropogenic impacts could drive shifts in fitness balances within these populations. We tested these predictions using a multi-taxa meta-analysis. Of 2,939 reviewed studies, 23 contained suitable information for meta-analysis, yielding 129 effect sizes. Of these, 73\% (n = 94) reported higher resident fitness, 22\% (n = 28) reported higher migrant fitness, and 5\% (n = 7) reported equal fitness. Once weighted for precision, we found balanced fitness benefits across the entire dataset, but a consistently higher fitness of residents over migrants in birds and herpetofauna (the best-sampled groups). Residency benefits were generally associated with survival, not breeding success, and increased with the number of years of data over which effect sizes were calculated, suggesting deviations from fitness parity are not due to sampling artefacts. A pervasive survival benefit to residency documented in recent literature could indicate that increased exposure to threats associated with anthropogenic change faced by migrating individuals may be shifting the relative fitness balance between strategies.},

May, Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems (Princeton University, Princeton, {NJ}, 1973)] developed a concise theoretical framework to investigate the limiting similarity of competitive species. His theoretical results show that no limiting similarity threshold of competitive species can be identified in the deterministic model system whereby species more similar than this threshold never coexist. Theoretically, for competitive species coexisting in an unvarying environment, deterministic interspecific interactions and demographic stochasticity can be considered two sides of a coin. To investigate how the “tension” between these two forces affects the coexistence of competing species, a simple two-species competitive system based only on May's model system is transformed into an equivalent replicator equation. The effect of demographic stochasticity on the system stability is measured by the expected drift of the Lyapunov function. Our main results show that the limiting similarity of competitive species should not be considered to be an absolute measure. Specifically, very similar competitive species should be able to coexist in an environment with a high productivity level but big differences between competitive species should be necessary in an ecosystem with a low productivity level.},

Recent results indicate that adaptive dynamics may often not converge to equilibrium points and instead generate complicated trajectories if evolution takes place in high-dimensional phenotype spaces. Even though some analytical results on diversification in complex phenotype spaces are available, to study this problem in general we need to reconstruct individual-based models from the adaptive dynamics generating the non-equilibrium dynamics. Here we first provide a method to construct individual-based models such that they faithfully reproduce the given adaptive dynamics attractor without diversification. We then show that a propensity to diversify can be introduced by adding Gaussian competition terms that generate frequency dependence while still preserving the same adaptive dynamics. For sufficiently strong competition, the disruptive selection generated by frequency-dependence overcomes the directional evolution along the selection gradient and leads to diversification in phenotypic directions that are orthogonal to the selection gradient.},

Using a synthetic framework of phenotypic evolution that draws from adaptive dynamics and quantitative genetics approaches, we explore how the number of traits under selection influences convergence stability and evolutionary stability in models for coevolution in multidimensional phenotype spaces. Our results allow us to identify three different effects of trait dimensionality on stability. First are (i) a “combinatorial effect”: without epistasis and genetic correlations, a higher number of trait dimensions offers more opportunities for equilibria to be unstable; and (ii) epistatic interactions, that is, fitness interactions between traits, which tend to destabilize evolutionary equilibria; this effect increases with the dimension of phenotype space. These first two effects influence both convergence stability and evolutionary stability, while (iii) genetic correlations (due, e.g., to pleiotropy or linkage disequilibrium) can affect only convergence stability. We illustrate the general prediction that increased dimensionality destabilizes evolutionary equilibria using examples drawn from well-studied classical models of frequency-dependent competition for resources, adaptation to a spatially heterogeneous environment, and antagonistic coevolution. In addition, our analyses show that increased dimensionality can favor diversification, for example, in the form of local adaptation, as well as evolutionary escape.},

The first approach is independent of any specific ecological model and based on curvature properties of the fitness landscape as a function of the dimension of the trait space. This approach indeed suggests a positive correlation between complexity and diversity. An assumption made in this first approach is that the potential for any pair of traits to interact in their effect on fitness is independent of the dimension of the trait space. In the second approach, we circumvent making this assumption by analyzing the evolutionary dynamics in an explicit consumer-resource model in which the shape of the fitness landscape emerges from the underlying mechanistic ecological model. In this model, consumers are characterized by several quantitative traits and feed on a multidimensional resource distribution. The consumer's feeding efficiency on the resource is determined by the match between consumer phenotype and resource item. This analysis supports a positive correlation between the complexity of the evolving consumer species and its potential to diversify with the additional insight that also increasing resource complexity facilitates diversification.},

	abstract = {In this paper we develop a dynamical theory of coevolution in ecological communities. The derivation explicitly accounts for the stochastic components of evolutionary change and is based on ecological processes at the level of the individual. We show that the coevolutionary dynamic can be envisaged as a directed random walk in the community's trait space. A quantitative description of this stochastic process in terms of a master equation is derived. By determining the first jump moment of this process we abstract the dynamic of the mean evolutionary path. To first order the resulting equation coincides with a dynamic that has frequently been assumed in evolutionary game theory. Apart from recovering this canonical equation we systematically establish the underlying assumptions. We provide higher order corrections and show that these can give rise to new, unexpected evolutionary effects including shifting evolutionary isoclines and evolutionary slowing down of mean paths as they approach evolutionary equilibria. Extensions of the derivation to more general ecological settings are discussed. In particular we allow for multi-trait coevolution and analyze coevolution under nonequilibrium population dynamics.},

In evolutionary game theory and theoretical ecology, however, this method is used less frequently to study demographic stochasticity. Here, we review the use of continuum limits in ecology and evolution. Starting with an individual-based model, we derive a large population size limit, a (stochastic) differential equation which is called continuum limit. By example of the Wright–Fisher diffusion, we outline how to compute the stationary distribution, the fixation probability of a certain type, and the mean extinction time using the continuum limit. In the context of the logistic growth equation, we approximate the quasi-stationary distribution in a finite population.},

	isbn = {978-0-691-12894-8},
	abstract = {"Understanding the mechanisms driving biological diversity remains a central problem in ecology and evolutionary biology. Traditional explanations assume that differences in selection pressures lead to different adaptations in geographically separated locations. This book takes a different approach and explores adaptive diversification--diversification rooted in ecological interactions and frequency-dependent selection. In any ecosystem, birth and death rates of individuals are affected by interactions with other individuals. What is an advantageous phenotype therefore depends on the phenotype of other individuals, and it may often be best to be ecologically different from the majority phenotype. Such rare-type advantage is a hallmark of frequency-dependent selection and opens the scope for processes of diversification that require ecological contact rather than geographical isolation. Michael Doebeli investigates adaptive diversification using the mathematical framework of adaptive dynamics. Evolutionary branching is a paradigmatic feature of adaptive dynamics that serves as a basic metaphor for adaptive diversification, and Doebeli explores the scope of evolutionary branching in many different ecological scenarios, including models of coevolution, cooperation, and cultural evolution. He also uses alternative modeling approaches. Stochastic, individual-based models are particularly useful for studying adaptive speciation in sexual populations, and partial differential equation models confirm the pervasiveness of adaptive diversification. Showing that frequency-dependent interactions are an important driver of biological diversity, Adaptive Diversification provides a comprehensive theoretical treatment of adaptive diversification"--Provided by publisher. "Adaptive biological diversification occurs when frequency-dependent selection generates advantages for rare phenotypes and induces a split of an ancestral lineage into multiple descendant lineages. Using adaptive dynamics theory, individual-based simulations, and partial differential equation models, this book illustrates that adaptive diversification due to frequency-dependent ecological interaction is a theoretically ubiquitous phenomenon"--Provided by publisher.},

	abstract = {Although the evolutionary response to random genetic drift is classically modelled as a sampling process for populations with fixed abundance, the abundances of populations in the wild fluctuate over time. Furthermore, since wild populations exhibit demographic stochasticity and since random genetic drift is in part due to demographic stochasticity, theoretical approaches are needed to understand the role of demographic stochasticity in eco-evolutionary dynamics. Here we close this gap for quantitative characters evolving in continuously reproducing populations by providing a framework to track the stochastic dynamics of abundance density across phenotypic space using stochastic partial differential equations. In the process we develop a set of heuristics to operationalize the powerful, but abstract theory of white noise and diffusion-limits of individual-based models. Applying these heuristics, we obtain stochastic ordinary differential equations that generalize classical expressions of ecological quantitative genetics. In particular, by supplying growth rate and reproductive variance as functions of abundance densities and trait values, these equations track population size, mean trait and additive genetic variance responding to mutation, demographic stochasticity, random genetic drift, deterministic selection and noise-induced selection. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by formulating a model of diffuse coevolution mediated by exploitative competition for a continuum of resources. In addition to trait and abundance distributions, this model predicts interaction networks defined by niche-overlap, competition coefficients, or selection gradients. Using a high-richness approximation, we find linear selection gradients and competition coefficients are uncorrelated, but magnitudes of linear selection gradients and quadratic selection gradients are both positively correlated with competition coefficients. Hence, competing species that strongly affect each other’s abundance tend to also impose selection on one another, but the directionality is not predicted. This approach contributes to the development of a synthetic theory of evolutionary ecology by formalizing first principle derivations of stochastic models tracking feedbacks of biological processes and the patterns of diversity they produce.},

Here we provide a general theoretical analysis of the role of demographic stochasticity in social evolution. We show that the evolutionary impact of stochasticity depends on how the social action alters the recipient’s life cycle. If the action alters the recipient’s death rate, then demographic stochasticity always favours altruism and disfavours spite. On the other hand, if the action alters the recipient’s birth rate, then stochasticity can either favour or disfavour both altruism and spite depending on the ratio of the rate of population turnover to the population size. Finally, we also show that this ratio is critical to determining if demographic stochasticity can reverse the direction of selection upon social traits. Our analysis thus provides a general understanding of the role of demographic stochasticity in social evolution.},

Arctic charr are exceptionally diverse, and in postglacial lakes there is strong evidence of repeated parallel evolution of similar morphologies associated with foraging. We measured head depth (a trait reflecting general eco-morphology and foraging ecology) of 1,091 individuals across 30 lake populations to test whether fish morphological variation was associated with lake bathymetry and/or ecological parameters. Across populations, we found a significant relationship between the variation in head depth of the charr and abiotic environmental characteristics: positively with ecosystem size (i.e., lake volume, surface area, depth) and negatively with the amount of littoral zone. In addition, extremely robust-headed phenotypes tended to be associated with larger and deeper lakes. We identified no influence of co-existing biotic community on Arctic charr trophic morphology.

Here, we examined morphological variation in body shape for replicate flocks of Nicaraguan Midas cichlid fishes and tested its association with biological and physical characteristics of their crater lakes. We found that variability of body elongation, an adaptive trait in freshwater fishes, is mainly predicted by average lake depth (N = 6, P {\textless} 0.001, R2 = 0.96). Other factors considered, including lake age, surface area, littoral zone area, number of co-occurring fish species, and genetic diversity of the Midas flock, did not significantly predict morphological variability. We also showed that lakes with a larger littoral zone have on average higher bodied Midas cichlids, indicating that Midas cichlid flocks are locally adapted to their crater lake habitats. In conclusion, we found that a lake's habitat predicts the magnitude and the diversity of body elongation in repeated cichlid adaptive radiations.},

If divergence proceeds by small mutational steps, the new species utilize almost the same resources initially, and full speciation may be impeded by competitive exclusion in stochastic environments. We investigate this primarily ecological problem of sympatric speciation by studying the population dynamics of a diverging asexual population in a fluctuating environment. Correlation between species responses to environmental fluctuation is assumed to decrease with distance in trait space. Rapidly declining correlation in combination with high environmental variability may delay full speciation or even render it impossible. Stochastic extinctions impeding speciation are most likely when correlation decays faster than competition, for example, when demographic stochasticity is strong or when divergence is not accompanied by niche separation, such as in speciation driven entirely by sexual selection.

We present a single, comprehensible analytical result which summarizes most effects of environmental fluctuations on evolutionary branching driven by resource competition. Corroborating earlier findings, we show that branching may be delayed or impeded if the underlying resources have uncorrelated or negatively correlated responses to environmental fluctuations. There is also a strong impeding effect of positive environmental autocorrelation, which can be related to results from recent experiments on adaptive radiation in bacterial microcosms.

	abstract = {Evolution can favour more than one reproductive tactic among conspecifics of the same sex1,2. Under the conditional evolutionarily stable strategy, individuals adopt the tactic that generates the highest fitness return for their status: large males guard females, whereas small males sneak copulations3,4. Tactics change at the status at which fitness benefits switch from favouring one tactic to favouring the alternative1,5. This ‘switchpoint’ is expressed in many species as a threshold between divergent morphologies3. Environmental and demographic parameters that influence the relative fitness of male tactics are predicted to determine a population's switchpoint1,5 and consequently whether the population is monomorphic or dimorphic. Here we show threshold evolution in the forceps dimorphism of the European earwig Forficula auricularia and document the transition from completely monomorphic to classical male-dimorphic populations over a distance of only 40 km. Because the superior fighting ability of the dominant morph6 will be more frequently rewarded at high encounter rates, population density is likely to be a key determinant of the relative fitness of the alternative tactics, and consequently the threshold. We show that, as predicted, population density correlates strongly with the shift in threshold, and that this factor drives the local evolution of the male dimorphism in these island populations. Our data provide evidence for the origin of phenotypic diversity within populations7,8,9, through the evolution of a switchpoint in a conditional strategy that has responded to local population density.},

	abstract = {It is unclear why sexually reproducing isogamous species frequently contain just two self-incompatible mating types. Deterministic theory suggests that since rare novel mating types experience a selective advantage (by virtue of their many potential partners), the number of mating types should consistently grow. However, in nature, species with thousands of mating types are exceedingly rare. Several competing theories for the predominance of species with two mating types exist, yet they lack an explanation for how many are possible and in which species to expect high numbers. Here, we present a theoretical null model that explains the distribution of mating type numbers using just three biological parameters: mutation rate, population size and the rate of sex. If the number of mating types results from a mutation–extinction balance, the rate of sexual reproduction plays a crucial role. If sex is facultative and rare (a very common combination in isogamous species), mating type diversity will remain low. In this rare sex regime, small fitness differences between the mating types lead to more frequent extinctions, further lowering mating type diversity. We also show that the empirical literature supports the role of drift and facultativeness of sex as a determinant of mating type dynamics.},

Specifically, we investigate the evolution of number of mating types, mode of mating type inheritance, and the molecular determinants of mating types across the taxonomic diversity of ciliates, with an emphasis on three well-studied genera: Tetrahymena, Paramecium, and Euplotes. We find that there have been many transitions in the number of mating types, and that the requirement of nuclear reorganization may be a more important factor than genetic exchange in determining the optimum number of mating types in a species. We also find that the molecular determinants of mating types and mode of inheritance are evolving under different constraints in different lineages of ciliates. Our results emphasize the need for further detailed examination of mating systems in understudied ciliate lineages.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary branching occurs when frequency‐dependent selection splits a phenotypically monomorphic population into two distinct phenotypic clusters. A prerequisite for evolutionary branching is that directional selection drives the population toward a fitness minimum in phenotype space. This article demonstrates that selection regimes leading to evolutionary branching readily arise from a wide variety of different ecological interactions within and between species. We use classical ecological models for symmetric and asymmetric competition, for mutualism, and for predator‐prey interactions to describe evolving populations with continuously varying characters. For these models, we investigate the ecological and evolutionary conditions that allow for evolutionary branching and establish that branching is a generic and robust phenomenon. Evolutionary branching becomes a model for sympatric speciation when population genetics and mating mechanisms are incorporated into ecological models. In sexual populations with random mating, the continual production of intermediate phenotypes from two incipient branches prevents evolutionary branching. In contrast, when mating is assortative for the ecological characters under study, evolutionary branching is possible in sexual populations and can lead to speciation. Therefore, we also study the evolution of assortative mating as a quantitative character. We show that evolution under branching conditions selects for assortativeness and thus allows sexual populations to escape from fitness minima. We conclude that evolutionary branching offers a general basis for understanding adaptive speciation and radiation under a wide range of different ecological conditions.},

In the context of population models they allow for the description of the transition from the vicinity of a non-trivial fixed point of the deterministic dynamics to a trivial fixed point, where the population has become extinct. To characterize analytically the fluctuations of a given stochastic population model, one can operate within the so-called linear-noise approximation. Here the fluctuations are taken to be Gaussian, and the phenomenon of extinction is so rare as to be negligible, for all practical purposes. When the size of the population becomes small, non-Gaussian fluctuations are instead found. Two analytical schemes are in principle available to determine the nature of the distribution of associated fluctuations: the generalized van Kampen system-size expansion beyond the conventional order of approximation and a {WKB}-like method. Here we investigate the accuracy of these two different approximation schemes, with reference to a simple stochastic process that converges to the logistic equation in the deterministic limit.},

Despite its fundamental importance in ecological systems, the concept is often treated as synonymous with unpredictability in community ecology, and studies tend to focus on single forms of stochasticity rather than taking a more holistic view. This has led to multiple narratives for how stochasticity mediates community dynamics. Here, we present a framework that describes how different forms of stochasticity (notably demographic and environmental stochasticity) combine to provide underlying and predictable structure in diverse communities. This framework builds on the deep ecological understanding of stochastic processes acting at individual and population levels and in modules of a few interacting species. We support our framework with a mathematical model that we use to synthesize key literature, demonstrating that stochasticity is more than simple uncertainty. Rather, stochasticity has profound and predictable effects on community dynamics that are critical for understanding how diversity is maintained. We propose next steps that ecologists might use to explore the role of stochasticity for structuring communities in theoretical and empirical systems, and thereby enhance our understanding of community dynamics.},

It is based on invasion fitness functions, which determine selection gradients and the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics. Even though the derivation of the adaptive dynamics from a given invasion fitness function is general and model-independent, the derivation of the invasion fitness function itself requires specification of an underlying ecological model. Therefore, evolutionary insights gained from adaptive dynamics models are generally model-dependent. Logistic models for symmetric, frequency-dependent competition are widely used in this context. Such models have the property that the selection gradients derived from them are gradients of scalar functions, which reflects a certain gradient property of the corresponding invasion fitness function. We show that any adaptive dynamics model that is based on an invasion fitness functions with this gradient property can be transformed into a generalized symmetric competition model. This provides a precise delineation of the generality of results derived from competition models. Roughly speaking, to understand the adaptive dynamics of the class of models satisfying a certain gradient condition, one only needs a complete understanding of the adaptive dynamics of symmetric, frequency-dependent competition. We show how this result can be applied to number of basic issues in evolutionary theory.},

By developing analytical Fourier methods we are able to probe this probabilistic framework, which gives us insight into the patterning potential of diffusive systems. Further, an alternative description of domain growth is introduced, with which we are able to rigorously link the mean-field and stochastic descriptions. Finally, through combining these ideas, it is shown that such stochastic descriptions of diffusion on a deterministically growing domain are able to support the nucleation of states that are far removed from the deterministic mean-field steady state.},

	abstract = {Spatial patterns in biological populations and the effect of spatial patterns on ecological interactions are central topics in mathematical ecology. Various approaches to modeling have been developed to enable us to understand spatial patterns ranging from plant distributions to plankton aggregation. We present a new approach to modeling spatial interactions by deriving approximations for the time evolution of the moments (mean and spatial covariance) of ensembles of distributions of organisms; the analysis is made possible by “moment closure,” neglecting higher-order spatial structure in the population. We use the growth and competition of plants in an explicitly spatial environment as a starting point for exploring the properties of second-order moment equations and comparing them to realizations of spatial stochastic models. We find that for a wide range of effective neighborhood sizes (each plant interacting with several to dozens of neighbors), the mean-covariance model provides a useful and analytically tractable approximation to the stochastic spatial model, and combines useful features of stochastic models and traditional reaction-diffusion-like models.},

	abstract = {We are interested in the study of models describing the evolution of a polymorphic population with mutation and selection in the specific scales of the biological framework of adaptive dynamics. The population size is assumed to be large and the mutation rate small. We prove that under a good combination of these two scales, the population process is approximated in the long time scale of mutations by a Markov pure jump process describing the successive trait equilibria of the population. This process, which generalizes the so-called trait substitution sequence ({TSS}), is called polymorphic evolution sequence ({PES}). Then we introduce a scaling of the size of mutations and we study the {PES} in the limit of small mutations. From this study in the neighborhood of evolutionary singularities, we obtain a full mathematical justification of a heuristic criterion for the phenomenon of evolutionary branching. This phenomenon corresponds to the situation where the population, initially essentially single modal, is driven by the selective forces to divide into two separate subpopulations. To this end we finely analyze the asymptotic behavior of three-dimensional competitive Lotka–Volterra systems.},

By contrast, in nature, species are composed of discrete individuals subject to demographic stochasticity and occur in habitats of finite size where extinctions occur in finite time. One consequence of these discrepancies is that metrics of species’ coexistence derived from deterministic theory may be unreliable predictors of the duration of species coexistence in nature. These coexistence metrics include invasion growth rates and niche and fitness differences, which are now commonly applied in theoretical and empirical studies of species coexistence. In this study, we tested the efficacy of deterministic coexistence metrics on the duration of species coexistence in a finite world. We introduce new theoretical and computational methods to estimate coexistence times in stochastic counterparts of classic deterministic models of competition. Importantly, we parameterized this model using experimental field data for 90 pairwise combinations of 18 species of annual plants, allowing us to derive biologically informed estimates of coexistence times for a natural system. Strikingly, we found that for species expected to deterministically coexist, community sizes containing only 10 individuals had predicted coexistence times of more than 1000 years. We also found that invasion growth rates explained 60\% of the variation in intrinsic coexistence times, reinforcing their general usefulness in studies of coexistence. However, only by integrating information on both invasion growth rates and species' equilibrium population sizes could most ({\textgreater}99\%) of the variation in species coexistence times be explained. This integration was achieved with demographically uncoupled single-species models solely determined by the invasion growth rates and equilibrium population sizes. Moreover, because of a complex relationship between niche overlap/fitness differences and equilibrium population sizes, increasing niche overlap and increasing fitness differences did not always result in decreasing coexistence times, as deterministic theory would predict. Nevertheless, our results tend to support the informed use of deterministic theory for understanding the duration of species’ coexistence while highlighting the need to incorporate information on species' equilibrium population sizes in addition to invasion growth rates.},

The game occurs within local neighbourhoods, which are subsets of the whole population. Free-riding and maximal production are two extremes of a continuous spectrum of traits. We study the adaptive dynamics of production and neighbourhood size. We allow the public good production and the neighbourhood size to coevolve and observe evolutionary branching. We explain how an initially monomorphic population undergoes evolutionary branching in two dimensions to become a dimorphic population characterized by extremes of the spectrum of trait values. We find that population size plays a crucial role in determining the final state of the population. Small populations may not branch or may be subject to extinction of a subpopulation after branching. In small populations, stochastic effects become important and we calculate the probability of subpopulation extinction. Our work elucidates the evolutionary origins of heterogeneity in local {PGGs} among individuals of two traits (production and neighbourhood size), and the effects of stochasticity in two-dimensional trait space, where novel effects emerge.},

Instead, we propose that evolutionary birth-death processes, in which individuals give birth and die at ever-changing rates, should be the basis of evolutionary theory, because such processes capture the fundamental events that generate evolutionary dynamics. In evolutionary birth-death processes, fitness is at best a derived quantity, and owing to the potential complexity of such processes, there is no guarantee that there is a simple scalar, such as fitness, that would describe long-term evolutionary outcomes. We discuss how evolutionary birth-death processes can provide useful perspectives on a number of central issues in evolution.},

Despite its fundamental importance in ecological systems, the concept is often treated as synonymous with unpredictability in community ecology, and studies tend to focus on single forms of stochasticity rather than taking a more holistic view. This has led to multiple narratives for how stochasticity mediates community dynamics. Here, we present a framework that describes how different forms of stochasticity (notably demographic and environmental stochasticity) combine to provide underlying and predictable structure in diverse communities. This framework builds on the deep ecological understanding of stochastic processes acting at individual and population levels and in modules of a few interacting species. We support our framework with a mathematical model that we use to synthesize key literature, demonstrating that stochasticity is more than simple uncertainty. Rather, stochasticity has profound and predictable effects on community dynamics that are critical for understanding how diversity is maintained. We propose next steps that ecologists might use to explore the role of stochasticity for structuring communities in theoretical and empirical systems, and thereby enhance our understanding of community dynamics.},

Taking a continuum limit of the moment equations while keeping the system size N fixed generates a system of integrodifferential equations for the mean and covariance of the corresponding stochastic neural field model. We also show how the path integral approach can be used to study large deviation or rare event statistics underlying escape from the basin of attraction of a stable fixed point of the mean-field dynamics; such an analysis is not possible using the system-size expansion since the latter cannot accurately determine exponentially small transitions.},

	abstract = {A well-defined stochastic theory for neural activity, which permits the calculation of arbitrary statistical moments and equations governing them, is a potentially valuable tool for theoretical neuroscience. We produce such a theory by analyzing the dynamics of neural activity using field theoretic methods for nonequilibrium statistical processes. Assuming that neural network activity is Markovian, we construct the effective spike model, which describes both neural fluctuations and response. This analysis leads to a systematic expansion of corrections to mean field theory, which for the effective spike model is a simple version of the Wilson-Cowan equation. We argue that neural activity governed by this model exhibits a dynamical phase transition which is in the universality class of directed percolation. More general models (which may incorporate refractoriness) can exhibit other universality classes, such as dynamic isotropic percolation. Because of the extremely high connectivity in typical networks, it is expected that higher-order terms in the systematic expansion are small for experimentally accessible measurements, and thus, consistent with measurements in neocortical slice preparations, we expect mean field exponents for the transition. We provide a quantitative criterion for the relative magnitude of each term in the systematic expansion, analogous to the Ginsburg criterion. Experimental identification of dynamic universality classes in vivo is an outstanding and important question for neuroscience.},

	abstract = {The modeling and simulation of stochastic reaction–diffusion processes is a topic of steady interest that is approached with a wide range of methods. At the level of particle-resolved descriptions, where chemical reactions are coupled to the spatial diffusion of individual particles, there exist comprehensive numerical simulation schemes, while the corresponding mathematical formalization is relatively underdeveloped. The aim of this paper is to provide a framework to systematically formulate the probabilistic evolution equation, termed chemical diffusion master equation ({CDME}), that governs particle-based stochastic reaction–diffusion processes. To account for the non-conserved and unbounded particle number of this type of open systems, we employ a classical analogue of the quantum mechanical Fock space that contains the symmetrized probability densities of the many-particle configurations in space. Following field-theoretical ideas of second quantization, we introduce creation and annihilation operators that act on single-particle densities and provide natural representations of symmetrized probability densities as well as of reaction and diffusion operators. These operators allow us to consistently and systematically formulate the {CDME} for arbitrary reaction schemes. The resulting form of the {CDME} further serves as the foundation to derive more coarse-grained descriptions of reaction–diffusion dynamics. In this regard, we show that a discretization of the evolution equation by projection onto a Fock subspace generated by a finite set of single-particle densities leads to a generalized form of the well-known reaction–diffusion master equation, which supports non-local reactions between grid cells and which converges properly in the continuum limit.},

In this article, we comparatively analyse applications of {WKB} and Fokker–Planck methods to some typical stochastic population dynamical models, including the logistic growth, endemic {SIR}, predator-prey, and competitive Lotka–Volterra models. The mean extinction time strongly depends on the nature of the corresponding deterministic fixed point(s). For different types of fixed points, the extinction can be driven either by rare events or typical Gaussian fluctuations. In the former case, the large deviation function that governs the distribution of rare events can be well-approximated by the {WKB} method in the weak noise limit. In the later case, the simpler Fokker–Planck approximation approach is also appropriate.},

Here, we studied a simple stochastic model for the time until speciation caused by geographical isolation in fragmented populations that experience recurrent but infrequent migration between subpopulations. We assumed that mating incompatibility is controlled by a number of loci that behave as neutral characters in the accumulation of novel mutations within each population. Genetic distance between populations was defined as the number of incompatibility-controlling loci that differ between them. Genetic distance increases through the separate accumulation of mutations in different populations, but decreases after a successful migration event followed by genetic mixing between migrants and residents. We calculated the time to allopatric speciation, which occurs when the genetic distance exceeds a specified threshold. If the number of invasive individuals relative to the resident population is not very large, diffusion approximation provides an accurate prediction. There is an intermediate optimal rate of migration that maximizes the rate of species creation by recurrent invasion and diversification. We also examined cases that involved more than two populations.},

	abstract = {Quantitative traits have long been hypothesized to affect speciation and extinction rates. For example, smaller body size or increased specialization may be associated with increased rates of diversification. Here, I present a phylogenetic likelihood-based method (quantitative state speciation and extinction [{QuaSSE}]) that can be used to test such hypotheses using extant character distributions. This approach assumes that diversification follows a birth–death process where speciation and extinction rates may vary with one or more traits that evolve under a diffusion model. Speciation and extinction rates may be arbitrary functions of the character state, allowing much flexibility in testing models of trait-dependent diversification. I test the approach using simulated phylogenies and show that a known relationship between speciation and a quantitative character could be recovered in up to 80\% of the cases on large trees (500 species). Consistent with other approaches, detecting shifts in diversification due to differences in extinction rates was harder than when due to differences in speciation rates. Finally, I demonstrate the application of {QuaSSE} to investigate the correlation between body size and diversification in primates, concluding that clade-specific differences in diversification may be more important than size-dependent diversification in shaping the patterns of diversity within this group.},

	abstract = {A characteristic signature of adaptive radiation is a slowing of the rate of speciation toward the present. On the basis of molecular phylogenies, studies of single clades have frequently found evidence for a slowdown in diversification rate and have interpreted this as evidence for density dependent speciation. However, we demonstrated via simulation that large clades are expected to show stronger slowdowns than small clades, even if the probability of speciation and extinction remains constant through time. This is a consequence of exponential growth: clades, which, by chance, diversify at above the average rate early in their history, will tend to be large. They will also tend to regress back to the average diversification rate later on, and therefore show a slowdown. We conducted a meta-analysis of the distribution of speciation events through time, focusing on sequence-based phylogenies for 45 clades of birds. Thirteen of the 23 clades (57\%) that include more than 20 species show significant slowdowns. The high frequency of slowdowns observed in large clades is even more extreme than expected under a purely stochastic constant-rate model, but is consistent with the adaptive radiation model. Taken together, our data strongly support a model of density-dependent speciation in birds, whereby speciation slows as ecological opportunities and geographical space place limits on clade growth.},

In this model, one or several quantitative traits are described as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic component, the first being distributed within families as a normal random variable centred at the average of the parental genetic components, and with a variance independent of the parental traits. Thus, the variance that segregates within families is not perturbed by selection, and can be predicted from the variance components. This does not necessarily imply that the trait distribution across the whole population should be Gaussian, and indeed selection or population structure may have a substantial effect on the overall trait distribution. One of our main aims is to identify some general conditions on the allelic effects for the infinitesimal model to be accurate. We first review the long history of the infinitesimal model in quantitative genetics. Then we formulate the model at the phenotypic level in terms of individual trait values and relationships between individuals, but including different evolutionary processes: genetic drift, recombination, selection, mutation, population structure, …. We give a range of examples of its application to evolutionary questions related to stabilising selection, assortative mating, effective population size and response to selection, habitat preference and speciation. We provide a mathematical justification of the model as the limit as the number M of underlying loci tends to infinity of a model with Mendelian inheritance, mutation and environmental noise, when the genetic component of the trait is purely additive. We also show how the model generalises to include epistatic effects. We prove in particular that, within each family, the genetic components of the individual trait values in the current generation are indeed normally distributed with a variance independent of ancestral traits, up to an error of order 1∕M. Simulations suggest that in some cases the convergence may be as fast as 1∕M.},

There is now a deeper understanding of how competitive interactions influence community structure, for instance, how the shape of competition kernels can determine the clustering of species’ traits. Competition is typically weaker for greater phenotypic difference, and the shape of the dependence defines a competition kernel. The clustering tendencies of kernels interact with other effects, such as variation in resource availability along a niche axis, but the kernel shape can have a decisive influence on community structure. Here we review and further extend the recent developments and evaluate their importance.},

	abstract = {A distinctive signature of living systems is Darwinian evolution, that is, a propensity to generate as well as self-select individual diversity. To capture this essential feature of life while describing the dynamics of populations, mathematical models must be rooted in the microscopic, stochastic description of discrete individuals characterized by one or several adaptive traits and interacting with each other. The simplest models assume asexual reproduction and haploid genetics: an offspring usually inherits the trait values of her progenitor, except when a mutation causes the offspring to take a mutation step to new trait values; selection follows from ecological interactions among individuals. Here we present a rigorous construction of the microscopic population process that captures the probabilistic dynamics over continuous time of birth, mutation, and death, as influenced by the trait values of each individual, and interactions between individuals. A by-product of this formal construction is a general algorithm for efficient numerical simulation of the individual-level model. Once the microscopic process is in place, we derive different macroscopic models of adaptive evolution. These models differ in the renormalization they assume, i.e. in the limits taken, in specific orders, on population size, mutation rate, mutation step, while rescaling time accordingly. The macroscopic models also differ in their mathematical nature: deterministic, in the form of ordinary, integro-, or partial differential equations, or probabilistic, like stochastic partial differential equations or superprocesses. These models include extensions of Kimura's equation (and of its approximation for small mutation effects) to frequency- and density-dependent selection. A novel class of macroscopic models obtains when assuming that individual birth and death occur on a short timescale compared with the timescale of typical population growth. On a timescale of very rare mutations, we establish rigorously the models of “trait substitution sequences” and their approximation known as the “canonical equation of adaptive dynamics”. We extend these models to account for mutation bias and random drift between multiple evolutionary attractors. The renormalization approach used in this study also opens promising avenues to study and predict patterns of life-history allometries, thereby bridging individual physiology, genetic variation, and ecological interactions in a common evolutionary framework.},

	abstract = {Frequency-dependent selection and demographic fluctuations play important roles in evolutionary and ecological processes. Under frequency-dependent selection, the average fitness of the population may increase or decrease based on interactions between individuals within the population. This should be reflected in fluctuations of the population size even in constant environments. Here, we propose a stochastic model that naturally combines these two evolutionary ingredients by assuming frequency-dependent competition between different types in an individual-based model. In contrast to previous game theoretic models, the carrying capacity of the population, and thus the population size, is determined by pairwise competition of individuals mediated by evolutionary games and demographic stochasticity. In the limit of infinite population size, the averaged stochastic dynamics is captured by deterministic competitive Lotka–Volterra equations. In small populations, demographic stochasticity may instead lead to the extinction of the entire population. Because the population size is driven by fitness in evolutionary games, a population of cooperators is less prone to go extinct than a population of defectors, whereas in the usual systems of fixed size the population would thrive regardless of its average payoff.},

It is believed that many species originated through allopatric divergence, where new species arise from geographically isolated populations of the same ancestral species1,2,3. In contrast, the possibility of sympatric speciation (in which new species arise without geographical isolation) has often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical difficulties2,3. Most previous models analysing sympatric speciation concentrated on particular aspects of the problem while neglecting others4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Here we present a model that integrates a novel combination of different features and show that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of competition for resources. We use multilocus genetics to describe sexual reproduction in an individual-based model, and we consider the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals mate preferentially with like individuals) depending either on an ecological character affecting resource use or on a selectively neutral marker trait. In both cases, evolution of assortative mating often leads to reproductive isolation between ecologically diverging subpopulations. When assortative mating depends on a marker trait, and is therefore not directly linked to resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between the marker and the ecological trait. Our theory conforms well with mounting empirical evidence for the sympatric origin of many species10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.},

Of particular interest is a type of singular strategy that is an evolutionary attractor from a great distance, but once in its neighbourhood a population becomes dimorphic and undergoes disruptive selection leading to evolutionary branching. Modelling the adaptive growth and branching of the evolutionary tree can thus be considered as a major application of the framework.

	abstract = {We present a class of systems of ordinary differential equations ({ODEs}), which we call ‘pod systems’, that offers a new perspective on dynamical systems defined on a spatial domain. Such systems are typically studied as partial differential equations, but pod systems bring the analytic techniques of {ODE} theory to bear on the problems, and are thus able to study behaviours and bifurcations that are not easily accessible to the standard methods. In particular, pod systems are specifically designed to study spatial dynamical systems that exhibit multi-modal solutions. A pod system is essentially a linear combination of parametrized functions in which the coefficients and parameters are variables whose dynamics are specified by a system of {ODEs}. That is, pod systems are concerned with the dynamics of functions of the form Ψ(s, t) = y1(t) ϕ(s; x1(t)) + ··· + {yN}(t) ϕ(s; {xN}(t)), where s ∊ Rn is the spatial variable and ϕ: Rn × Rd → R. The parameters xi ∊ Rd and coefficients yi ∊ R are dynamic variables which evolve according to some system of {ODEs}, and , for i = 1, …, N. The dynamics of Ψ in function space can then be studied through the dynamics of the x and y in finite dimensions. A vital feature of pod systems is that the {ODEs} that specify the dynamics of the x and y variables are not arbitrary; restrictions on Gi and Hi are required to guarantee that the dynamics of Ψ in function space are well defined (that is, that trajectories are unique). One important restriction is symmetry in the {ODEs} which arises because Ψ is invariant under permutations of the indices of the (xi, yi) pairs. However, this is not the whole story, and the primary goal of this paper is to determine the necessary structure of the {ODEs} explicitly to guarantee that the dynamics of Ψ are well defined.},

An offspring usually inherits the trait values of her progenitor, except when a mutation causes the offspring to take an instantaneous mutation step at birth to new trait values. We look for tractable large population approximations. By combining various scalings on population size, birth and death rates, mutation rate, mutation step, or time, a single microscopic model is shown to lead to contrasting macroscopic limits of a different nature: deterministic, in the form of ordinary, integro-, or partial differential equations, or probabilistic, like stochastic partial differential equations or superprocesses. In the limit of rare mutations, we show that a possible approximation is a jump process, justifying rigorously the so-called trait substitution sequence.

In particular, by starting from a population-level model of density distributions in trait space, we derive what amounts to an extension of the typical models at the species level known from adaptive dynamics literature, to account not only for abundance and mean trait values, but also explicitly for trait variances. Thus, we arrive at an explicitly polymorphic model at the species level. The derivations make precise the relationship between the parameters in the two classes of models and allow us to distinguish between notions of fitness on the population and species levels. Through a formal stability analysis, we see that exponential growth of an eigenvalue in the trait covariance matrix corresponds to a breakdown of the underlying assumptions of the species-level model. In biological terms, this may be interpreted as a speciation event: that is, we obtain an explicit notion of the blow-up of the variance of (possibly a linear combination of) traits as a precursor to speciation. Moreover, since evolutionary volatility of the mean trait value is proportional to trait variance, this provides a notion that species at the cusp of speciation are also the most adaptive. We illustrate these concepts and considerations using a numerical simulation.},

	abstract = {Ecological interaction, including competition for resources, often causes frequency-dependent disruptive selection, which, when accompanied by reproductive isolation, may act as driving forces of adaptive speciation. While adaptive dynamics models have added new perspectives to our understanding of the ecological dimensions of speciation processes, it remains an open question how best to incorporate and analyze genetic detail in such models. Conventional approaches, based on quantitative genetics theory, typically assume a unimodal character distribution and examine how its moments change over time. Such approximations inevitably fail when a character distribution becomes multimodal. Here, we propose a new approximation, oligomorphic dynamics, to the quantitative genetics of populations that include several morphs and that therefore exhibit multiple peaks in their character distribution. To this end, we first decompose the character distribution into a sum of unimodal distributions corresponding to individual morphs. Characterizing these morphs by their frequency (fraction of individuals belonging to each morph), position (mean character of each morph), and width (standard deviation of each morph), we then derive the coupled eco-evolutionary dynamics of morphs through a double Taylor expansion. We show that the demographic, convergence, and evolutionary stability of a population’s character distribution correspond, respectively, to the asymptotic stability of frequencies, positions, and widths under the oligomorphic dynamics introduced here. As first applications of oligomorphic dynamics theory, we analytically derive the effects (a) of the strength of disruptive selection on waiting times until speciation, (b) of mutation on conditions for speciation, and (c) of the fourth moments of competition kernels on patterns of speciation.},

	abstract = {Noise, as the term itself suggests, is most often seen a nuisance to ecological insight, a inconvenient reality that must be acknowledged, a haystack that must be stripped away to reveal the processes of interest underneath. Yet despite this well-earned reputation, noise is often interesting in its own right: noise can induce novel phenomena that could not be understood from some underlying deterministic model alone. Nor is all noise the same, and close examination of differences in frequency, colour or magnitude can reveal insights that would otherwise be inaccessible. Yet with each aspect of stochasticity leading to some new or unexpected behaviour, the time is right to move beyond the familiar refrain of “everything is important” (Bjørnstad \& Grenfell ). Stochastic phenomena can suggest new ways of inferring process from pattern, and thus spark more dialog between theory and empirical perspectives that best advances the field as a whole. I highlight a few compelling examples, while observing that the study of stochastic phenomena are only beginning to make this translation into empirical inference. There are rich opportunities at this interface in the years ahead.},

In this model, we assume that the population size is finite but not fixed and that all individuals have, in addition to the frequency-dependent fitness given by the evolutionary game, the same background fitness that decreases linearly in the total population size. Although this assumption guarantees population extinction is a globally attracting absorbing barrier of the Markov process, sample trajectories do not illustrate this result even for relatively small carrying capacities. Instead, the observed persistent transient behavior can be analyzed using the steady-state statistics (i.e., mean and variance) of a stochastic model for intrinsic noise that assumes the population does not go extinct. It is shown that there is good agreement between the theory of these statistics and the simulation results. Furthermore, the {ESS} of the evolutionary game can be used to predict the mean steady state.},

However, recent work has emphasized the importance of transient dynamics rather than long-term behavior in ecological systems, enabling the examination of forces that allow coexistence on ecological timescales.

In evolutionary game theory, models of fixation have typically focused on fixed population sizes and frequency-dependent selection. A combination of demographic fluctuations with frequency-dependent interactions such as Lotka–Volterra dynamics has received comparatively little attention. We consider a stochastic, competitive Lotka–Volterra model with higher order interactions between two traits. The emerging individual-based model allows for stochastic fluctuations in the frequencies of the two traits and the total population size. We calculate the fixation probability of a trait under differing competition coefficients. This fixation probability resembles, qualitatively, the deterministic evolutionary dynamics. Furthermore, we partially disentangle the selection effects into their ecological and evolutionary components. We find that changing the evolutionary selection strength also changes the population dynamics and vice versa. Thus, a clean separation of the ecological and evolutionary effects is not possible. Instead, our results imply a nested interaction of the evolutionary and ecological effects. The entangled eco-evolutionary processes thus cannot be ignored when determining fixation properties in a co-evolutionary system.},

	abstract = {We consider the collective behavior of active particles that locally align with their neighbors. Agent-based simulation models have previously shown that in one dimension, these particles can form into a flock that maintains its stability by stochastically alternating its direction. Until now, this behavior has been seen in models based on continuum field equations only by appealing to long-range interactions that are not present in the simulation model. Here, we derive a set of stochastic field equations with local interactions that reproduces both qualitatively and quantitatively the behavior of the agent-based model, including the alternating flock phase. A crucial component is a multiplicative noise term of the voter model type in the dynamics of the local polarization whose magnitude is inversely proportional to the local density. We show that there is an important subtlety in determining the physically appropriate noise, in that it depends on a careful choice of the field variables used to characterize the system. We further use the resulting equations to show that a nonlinear alignment interaction of at least cubic order is needed for flocking to arise.},

Here, we model this process analytically, in the plausible setting of a highly polygenic, quantitative trait that experiences a sudden shift in the fitness optimum. We show how the mean phenotype changes over time, depending on the effect sizes of loci that contribute to variance in the trait, and characterize the allele dynamics at these loci. Notably, we describe the two phases of the allele dynamics: The first is a rapid phase, in which directional selection introduces small frequency differences between alleles whose effects are aligned with or opposed to the shift, ultimately leading to small differences in their probability of fixation during a second, longer phase, governed by stabilizing selection. As we discuss, key results should hold in more general settings and have important implications for efforts to identify the genetic basis of adaptation in humans and other species.},

	abstract = {Fluctuations and noise may alter the behaviour of dynamical systems considerably. For example, oscillations may be sustained by demographic fluctuations in biological systems where a stable fixed point is found in the absence of noise. We here extend the theoretical analysis of such stochastic effects to models which have a limit cycle for some range of the model parameters. We formulate a description of fluctuations about the periodic orbit which allows the relation between the stochastic oscillations in the fixed-point phase and the oscillations in the limit cycle phase to be elucidated. In the case of the limit cycle, a suitable transformation into a co-moving frame allows fluctuations transverse and longitudinal with respect to the limit cycle to be effectively decoupled. While longitudinal fluctuations are of a diffusive nature, those in the transverse direction follow a stochastic path more akin to that of an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. Their power spectrum is computed analytically within a van Kampen expansion in the inverse system size. The subsequent comparison with numerical simulations, carried out in two different ways, illustrates the effects that can occur due to diffusion in the longitudinal direction.},

A first-principles understanding of these dynamics can provide insights into causes of population regulation and help with selecting detailed predictive models. A particularly difficult challenge is determining the relative role of deterministic versus stochastic forces in producing oscillations. We employ statistical physics concepts, including measures of spatial synchrony, that incorporate patterns at all scales and are novel to ecology, to show that spatial patterns can, under broad and well-defined circumstances, elucidate drivers of population dynamics. We find that when neighbours are coupled (e.g. by dispersal), noisy intrinsic oscillations become distinguishable from noise-induced oscillations at a transition point related to synchronisation that is distinct from the deterministic bifurcation point. We derive this transition point and show that it diverges from the deterministic bifurcation point as stochasticity increases. The concept of universality suggests that the results are robust and widely applicable.},

Mathematical methods are therefore gaining in importance across the life- and biomedical sciences.

It has been argued that mathematical methods can be of great benefit to biologists to make sense of data.

Recent single-cell transcriptomic data provide new opportunities for quantifying this originally conceptual tool, offering insight into the gene regulatory networks underlying cellular development. While many methods for constructing the landscape have been proposed, by far the most commonly employed approach is based on computing the landscape as the negative logarithm of the steady-state probability distribution. Here, we use simple models to highlight the complexities and limitations that arise when reconstructing the potential landscape in the presence of stochastic fluctuations. We consider how the landscape changes in accordance with different stochastic systems and show that it is the subtle interplay between the deterministic and stochastic components of the system that ultimately shapes the landscape. We further discuss how the presence of noise has important implications for the identifiability of the regulatory dynamics from experimental data.

Focusing on small- to intermediate-sized groups (10 ≲ N ≲ 100), we demonstrate that schooling (highly polarized and coherent motion) is noise induced, arising from the intrinsic stochasticity associated with finite numbers of interacting fish. The fewer the fish, the greater the (multiplicative) noise and therefore the greater the likelihood of alignment. Such rare empirical evidence tightly constrains the possible underlying interactions that govern fish alignment, suggesting that E. suratensis either spontaneously change their direction or copy the direction of another fish, without any local averaging (the otherwise canonical mechanism of collective alignment). Our study therefore highlights the importance of stochasticity in behavioural inference. Furthermore, rather than simply obscuring otherwise deterministic dynamics, noise can be fundamental to the characterization of emergent collective behaviours.},

Such systems are typically modelled as chemical reaction networks whose dynamics are governed by the chemical master equation. Despite its simple structure, no analytic solutions to the chemical master equation are known for most systems. Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive, making systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task. Consequently, significant effort has been spent in recent decades on the development of efficient approximation and inference methods. This article gives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of state of the art methods. First, we motivate and introduce deterministic and stochastic methods for modelling chemical networks, and give an overview of simulation and exact solution methods. Next, we discuss several approximation methods, including the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion, moment closure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid methods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and remaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of these methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight some of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of inference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent methods developed the literature. In summary, this review gives a self-contained introduction to modelling, approximations and inference methods for stochastic chemical kinetics.},

In the steady state of populations comprising two or more species, it is permissible for a probability current to flow. In such a case, the system does not relax to equilibrium but instead reaches a nonequilibrium steady state. In a two-species model, these currents form cycles (e.g., ellipses) in probability space. We investigate the conditions under which such currents are solely responsible for macroscopically observable cycles in population abundances. We find that this can be achieved when the deterministic limit yields a circular neutrally stable manifold. We further discuss the efficacy of one-dimensional approximation to the diffusion on the manifold, and obtain estimates for the macroscopically observable current around this manifold by appealing to Kramers’ escape-rate theory.},

	abstract = {We introduce a class of stochastic population models based on “patch dynamics.” The size of the patch may be varied, and this allows one to quantify the departures of these stochastic models from various mean-field theories, which are generally valid as the patch size becomes very large. These models may be used to formulate a broad range of biological processes in both spatial and nonspatial contexts. Here, we concentrate on two-species competition. We present both a mathematical analysis of the patch model, in which we derive the precise form of the competition mean-field equations (and their first-order corrections in the nonspatial case), and simulation results. These mean-field equations differ, in some important ways, from those which are normally written down on phenomenological grounds. Our general conclusion is that mean-field theory is more robust for spatial models than for a single isolated patch. This is due to the dilution of stochastic effects in a spatial setting resulting from repeated rescue events mediated by interpatch diffusion. However, discrete effects due to modest patch sizes lead to striking deviations from mean-field theory even in a spatial setting.},

	abstract = {The origin of homochirality, the observed single-handedness of biological amino acids and sugars, has long been attributed to autocatalysis, a frequently assumed precursor for early life self-replication. However, the stability of homochiral states in deterministic autocatalytic systems relies on cross-inhibition of the two chiral states, an unlikely scenario for early life self-replicators. Here we present a theory for a stochastic individual-level model of autocatalytic prebiotic self-replicators that are maintained out of thermal equilibrium. Without chiral inhibition, the racemic state is the global attractor of the deterministic dynamics, but intrinsic multiplicative noise stabilizes the homochiral states. Moreover, we show that this noise-induced bistability is robust with respect to diffusion of molecules of opposite chirality, and systems of diffusively coupled autocatalytic chemical reactions synchronize their final homochiral states when the self-replication is the dominant production mechanism for the chiral molecules. We conclude that nonequilibrium autocatalysis is a viable mechanism for homochirality, without imposing additional nonlinearities such as chiral inhibition.},

	abstract = {Neural field theory has a long-standing tradition in the mathematical and computational neurosciences. Beginning almost 50 years ago with seminal work by Griffiths and culminating in the 1970ties with the models of Wilson and Cowan, Nunez and Amari, this important research area experienced a renaissance during the 1990ties by the groups of Ermentrout, Robinson, Bressloff, Wright and Haken. Since then, much progress has been made in both, the development of mathematical and numerical techniques and in physiological refinement und understanding. In contrast to large-scale neural network models described by huge connectivity matrices that are computationally expensive in numerical simulations, neural field models described by connectivity kernels allow for analytical treatment by means of methods from functional analysis. Thus, a number of rigorous results on the existence of bump and wave solutions or on inverse kernel construction problems are nowadays available. Moreover, neural fields provide an important interface for the coupling of neural activity to experimentally observable data, such as the electroencephalogram ({EEG}) or functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}). And finally, neural fields over rather abstract feature spaces, also called dynamic fields, found successful applications in the cognitive sciences and in robotics. Up to now, research results in neural field theory have been disseminated across a number of distinct journals from mathematics, computational neuroscience, biophysics, cognitive science and others. There is no comprehensive collection of results or reviews available yet. With our proposed book Neural Field Theory, we aim at filling this gap in the market. We received consent from some of the leading scientists in the field, who are willing to write contributions for the book, among them are two of the founding-fathers of neural field theory: Shun-ichi Amari and Jack Cowan.},

Through analytical methods supported by numerical simulations, we address this issue by studying the properties of a paradigmatic non-spatial three-species stochastic system, namely, the “rock-paper-scissors” or cyclic Lotka-Volterra model. While the deterministic approach (rate equations) predicts the coexistence of the species resulting in regular (yet neutrally stable) oscillations of the population densities, we demonstrate that fluctuations arising in the system with a finite number of agents drastically alter this picture and are responsible for extinction: After long enough time, two of the three species die out. As main findings we provide analytic estimates and numerical computation of the extinction probability at a given time. We also discuss the implications of our results for a broad class of competing population systems.},

However, this measure was initially derived for models with infinite population sizes, where the long-term evolutionary behavior can be described with certainty. In this paper we begin an exploration of the limitations and utility of this approach to evolution in finite populations and discuss alternate methods for predicting evolutionary dynamics. We reanalyze a model of lottery competition under environmental stochasticity by including population finiteness, and show that the geometric mean predictions do not always agree with those based on the fixation probability of rare alleles. Further, the fixation probability can be inserted into adaptive dynamics equations to derive the mean state of the population. We explore the effects of increasing population size on these conclusions through simulations. These simulations show that for small population sizes the fixation probability accurately predicts the course of evolution, but as population size becomes large the geometric mean predictions are upheld. The two approaches are reconciled because the time scale on which the fixation probability approach applies becomes very large as population size grows.},

	abstract = {One way of analysing complicated Markov population processes is to approximate them by a diffusion about the deterministic path. This approximation alone may not, however, answer all the questions which might reasonably be asked. Many processes have phases, for example near boundaries, where a different approximation is required; such processes are better described by a succession of diffusion and special approximations alternately.This paper looks at the special treatment required near a point where the deterministic equations are in equilibrium. When the equilibrium is unstable, the process will eventually wander off, and possibly follow a diffusion around another deterministic path. If the equilibrium is stable, the process will behave as if in stable equilibrium about it for a very much longer time, but may at last be trapped away from it, for instance in an absorbing state. The results presented describe the distributions of the time and place of leaving neighbourhoods of the equilibrium point. The neighbourhoods considered are large enough, in the unstable case, to make possible the link with the next phase of motion. In the stable case, exit times are shown to be so long that the possibility of exit can often be ignored in practice, and the quasi-equilibrium distribution treated as a true equilibrium. A more detailed result, showing how closely the normal approximation holds in this situation, is also provided.},

They could seem to be in contradiction with natural selection, as non-cooperators have an increased fitness compared to cooperators. Understanding the emergence of cooperation has necessitated the development of concepts and models (inclusive fitness, multilevel selection, etc.) attributing deterministic advantages to this behavior. In contrast to these models, we show here that cooperative behaviors can emerge by taking into account only the stochastic nature of evolutionary dynamics: when cooperative behaviors increase the population size, they also increase the genetic drift against non-cooperators. Using the Wright–Fisher models of population genetics, we compute exactly this increased genetic drift and its consequences on the fixation probability of both types of individuals. This computation leads to a simple criterion: cooperative behavior dominates when the relative increase in population size caused by cooperators is higher than the selection pressure against them. This is a purely stochastic effect with no deterministic interpretation.},

I argue that although its fundamental status is justified by its simplicity and scope, there are additional results that seem similarly fundamental. I suggest that the most fundamental theorem of evolution is the Price equation, both because of its simplicity and broad scope and because it can be used to derive four other familiar results that are similarly fundamental: Fisher’s average-excess equation, Robertson’s secondary theorem of natural selection, the breeder’s equation, and Fisher’s fundamental theorem. These derivations clarify both the relationships behind these results and their assumptions. Slightly less fundamental results include those for multivariate evolution and social selection. A key feature of fundamental theorems is that they have great simplicity and scope, which are often achieved by sacrificing perfect accuracy. Quantitative genetics has been more productive of fundamental theorems than population genetics, probably because its empirical focus on unknown genotypes freed it from the tyranny of detail and allowed it to focus on general issues.},

	abstract = {Theoretical models pertaining to feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes are prevalent in multiple biological fields. An integrative overview is currently lacking, due to little crosstalk between the fields and the use of different methodological approaches. Here, we review a wide range of models of eco-evolutionary feedbacks and highlight their underlying assumptions. We discuss models where feedbacks occur both within and between hierarchical levels of ecosystems, including populations, communities and abiotic environments, and consider feedbacks across spatial scales. Identifying the commonalities among feedback models, and the underlying assumptions, helps us better understand the mechanistic basis of eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks can be readily modelled by coupling demographic and evolutionary formalisms. We provide an overview of these approaches and suggest future integrative modelling avenues. Our overview highlights that eco-evolutionary feedbacks have been incorporated in theoretical work for nearly a century. Yet, this work does not always include the notion of rapid evolution or concurrent ecological and evolutionary time scales. We show the importance of density- and frequency-dependent selection for feedbacks, as well as the importance of dispersal as a central linking trait between ecology and evolution in a spatial context.

To support this claim, we outline some unnoticed structural similarities between physical theories (in particular, classical mechanics) and evolutionary biology. More specifically, we shall argue that the Price equation, in the same way as fundamental formalisms in physics, can serve as a heuristic principle to formulate and systematise different theories and models in evolutionary biology.},

This leads to an absurd prediction that life evolves to ever-faster growth rates, yet no one seriously claims generally slower population growth rates in the Triassic compared with the present day. I review here, using non-technical language, how fitness can improve yet stay constant (stagnation paradox), and why an unambiguous measure of population fitness does not exist. Subfields use different terminology for aspects of the paradox, referring to stasis, cryptic evolution or the difficulty of choosing an appropriate fitness measure; known resolutions likewise use diverse terms from environmental feedback to density dependence and ‘evolutionary environmental deterioration’. The paradox vanishes when these concepts are understood, and adaptation can lead to declining reproductive output of a population when individuals can improve their fitness by exploiting conspecifics. This is particularly readily observable when males participate in a zero-sum game over paternity and population output depends more strongly on female than male fitness. Even so, the jury is still out regarding the effect of sexual conflict on population fitness. Finally, life-history theory and genetic studies of microevolutionary change could pay more attention to each other.},

A major challenge of this theoretical work has been to unravel the tangled feedback loop between ecology and evolution. This has prompted the development of two main classes of models. While quantitative genetics models jointly consider the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of a focal population, a separation of timescales between ecology and evolution is assumed by evolutionary game theory, adaptive dynamics, and inclusive fitness theory. As a result, theoretical evolutionary ecology tends to be divided among different schools of thought, with different toolboxes and motivations. My aim in this synthesis is to highlight the connections between these different approaches and clarify the current state of theory in evolutionary ecology. Central to this approach is to make explicit the dependence on environmental dynamics of the population and evolutionary dynamics, thereby materializing the eco-evolutionary feedback loop. This perspective sheds light on the interplay between environmental feedback and the timescales of ecological and evolutionary processes. I conclude by discussing some potential extensions and challenges to our current theoretical understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics.},

	abstract = {The Price equation shows that evolutionary change can be written in terms of two fundamental variables: the fitness of parents (or ancestors) and the phenotypes of their offspring (descendants). Its power lies in the fact that it requires no simplifying assumptions other than a closed population, but realizing the full potential of Price’s result requires that we flesh out the mathematical representation of both fitness and offspring phenotype. Specifically, both need to be treated as stochastic variables that are themselves functions of parental phenotype. Here, I show how new mathematical tools allow us to do this without introducing any simplifying assumptions. Combining this representation of fitness and phenotype with the stochastic Price equation reveals fundamental rules underlying multivariate evolution and the evolution of inheritance. Finally, I show how the change in the entire phenotype distribution of a population, not simply the mean phenotype, can be written as a single compact equation from which the Price equation and related results can be derived as special cases.

Deriving fundamental results in these fields under the unifying framework of the Price equation illuminates similarities and differences between approaches and allows a simple, unified view of game-theoretical and dynamic concepts. Using Taylor polynomials and the Price equation, I derive a dynamic measure of evolutionary change, a condition for singular points, the convergence stability criterion, and an alternative interpretation of evolutionary stability. Furthermore, by applying the Price equation to a multivariable Taylor polynomial, the direct fitness approach to kin selection emerges.

	abstract = {The research framework of eco-evolutionary dynamics is increasing in popularity, as revealed by a steady stream of review articles and a recent and influential book, but primary empirical research is lagging behind. Moreover, the few empirical case studies demonstrating eco-evolutionary dynamics might not be entirely representative. Much current research on eco-evolutionary dynamics is focused on how ecological interactions lead to natural selection on phenotypic traits (“eco-evo”), and in turn how the evolutionary change in such traits feed back on ecological dynamics (“evo-eco”). A key feature of eco-evolutionary dynamics is thus a feedback loop between ecology (e.g., population dynamics) and evolution (i.e., genetic change). In contrast to previous research on eco-evolutionary dynamics driven by natural selection, the role of eco-evolutionary feedbacks in sexual selection and sexual conflict is largely unknown. Here, I review theory and the limited empirical evidence in this area and identify some promising future lines of research. I update a past review on contemporary evolution of secondary sexual traits in natural populations and formulate six explicit and rigorous criteria for contemporary evolution of secondary sexual traits by natural or sexual selection or sexual conflict. I then discuss the other key prediction of eco-evolutionary dynamics (i.e., evolution by sexual selection or sexual conflict shapes ecological dynamics). My overview reveals that our current knowledge in this area is limited and mainly come from theoretical models and laboratory experiments. A major challenge in eco-evolutionary dynamics is therefore to link ecological and population dynamics with sexual selection and sexual conflict. This is not an easy task but might be possible with carefully chosen study systems and methods. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

It has been used to derive the most general versions of kin selection theory, and Price himself produced a multilevel equation that provides an alternative formulation of social evolution theory, dividing selection into components between and within groups. In this sense, the Price equation forms a basis for both kin and group selection, so often pitted against each other in the literature. Contextual analysis and the neighbour approach are prominent alternatives for analysing group selection. I discuss these four approaches to social evolution theory and their connections to the Price equation, focusing on their similarities and common mathematical structure. Despite different notations and modelling traditions, all four approaches are ultimately linked by a common set of mathematical components, revealing their underlying unity in a transparent way. The Price equation can similarly be used in the derivation of streamlined, weak selection social evolution modelling methods. These weak selection models are practical and powerful methods for constructing models in evolutionary and behavioural ecology; they can clarify the causal structure of models, and can be easily converted between the four social evolution approaches just like their regression counterparts.

Game theory focuses on evolutionary outcomes, with models solving for evolutionarily stable equilibria, whereas quantitative genetics provides insight into evolutionary processes, with models predicting short-term responses to selection. Here we draw parallels between evolutionary game theory and interacting phenotypes theory, which is a quantitative genetic framework for understanding social evolution. First, we show how any evolutionary game may be translated into two quantitative genetic selection gradients, nonsocial and social selection, which may be used to predict evolutionary change from a single round of the game. We show that synergistic fitness effects may alter predicted selection gradients, causing changes in magnitude and sign as the population mean evolves. Second, we show how evolutionary games involving plastic behavioral responses to partners can be modeled using indirect genetic effects, which describe how trait expression changes in response to genes in the social environment. We demonstrate that repeated social interactions in models of reciprocity generate indirect effects and conversely, that estimates of parameters from indirect genetic effect models may be used to predict the evolution of reciprocity. We argue that a pluralistic view incorporating both theoretical approaches will benefit empiricists and theorists studying social evolution. We advocate the measurement of social selection and indirect genetic effects in natural populations to test the predictions from game theory and, in turn, the use of game theory models to aid in the interpretation of quantitative genetic estimates.},

We show that, in an appropriate limit, the model describes standard evolutionary games with both genetic drift and overall population size fluctuations. However, there are also regimes where a varying population size can strongly influence the evolutionary dynamics. We focus on the strong mutualism scenario and demonstrate that standard evolutionary game theory fails to describe our simulation results. We then analytically and numerically determine fixation probabilities as well as mean fixation times using matched asymptotic expansions, taking into account the population size degree of freedom.

	abstract = {An essential topic in theoretical ecology is the extinction of populations subject to demographic stochasticity. Mechanistic models of demographic stochasticity, such as birth-death processes, can be analytically intractable, so are frequently approximated with stochastic differential equations ({SDEs}). Here, we consider two pitfalls in this type of approximation. First, familiar deterministic models are not always appropriate for use in an {SDE}. Second, the common practice of starting directly from an {SDE} without explicitly constructing a mechanistic model leaves the noise term up to the modeler’s discretion. Since the stability of stochastic models depends on the global properties of both the noise and the deterministic model, overly phenomenological deterministic models, or heuristic choices of noise, can lead to models that are unrealistically stable. The goal of this article is to provide an example of how both of these effects can undermine seemingly reasonable models. Following Dennis et al. (Theor Ecol 9:323–335 2016) and Levine and Meerson ({PRE}, 87:032127 2013), we compare the persistence of stochastic extensions of standard logistic and Allee models. We show that, for common choices of noise, stochastic logistic models become exponentially less extinction prone when a strong Allee effect is introduced. This apparent paradox can be resolved by recognizing that common models of an Allee effect introduce overcompensation that dominates the extinction dynamics, even when the deterministic model is rescaled to account for overcompensation. These problems can be resolved by mechanistic treatment of the deterministic model and the noise.},

Suppose the fitness fi is any continuous function of all the populations P1,…,Pn. Let pi be the fraction of replicators that are of the ith type. Then p=(p1,…,pn) is a time-dependent probability distribution, and we prove that its speed as measured by the Fisher information metric equals the variance in fitness. In rough terms, this says that the speed at which information is updated through natural selection equals the variance in fitness. This result can be seen as a modified version of Fisher’s fundamental theorem of natural selection. We compare it to Fisher’s original result as interpreted by Price, Ewens and Edwards.},

	abstract = {Population turnover, a key trait shaped by the organism’s life history strategy, plays an important role in eco-evolutionary dynamics by fixing the timescale for individual birth and death events as well as in determining the level of demographic stochasticity related to growth. Yet, the standard theory of population genetics, and the models heavily used in the related data analysis, have largely ignored the role of turnover. Here we propose a reformulation of population genetics starting from the first principles of birth and death and show that the role of turnover is evolutionarily important. We derive a general stochastic differential equation for the frequency dynamics of competing birth-death processes and determine the appropriate turnover corrections for the essential results regarding fixation, establishment, and substitution of mutants. Our results reveal how both the absolute and relative turnover rates influence evolution. We further describe a deterministic turnover selection, the turnover flux, which operates in small populations. Finally, we analyse the evolution of mean turnover and show how it explains the key eco-evolutionary mechanisms underlying demographic transitions. In conclusion, our results explicitly show how competing life-history strategies, demographic stochasticity, ecological feedback, and evolution are inseparably intertwined, thus calling for a unified theory development starting from the underlying mechanisms of birth and death.},

	abstract = {How life-history strategies influence the evolution of populations is not well understood. Most existing models stem from the Wright–Fisher model which considers discrete generations and a fixed population size, thus not taking into account any potential consequences of overlapping generations and demographic stochasticity on allelic frequencies. We introduce an individual-based model in which both population size and genotypic frequencies at a single bi-allelic locus are emergent properties of the model. Demographic parameters can be defined so as to represent a large range of r and K life-history strategies in a stable environment, and appropriate fixed effective population sizes are calculated so as to compare our model to the Wright–Fisher diffusion. Our results indicate that models with fixed population size that stem from the Wright–Fisher diffusion cannot fully capture the consequences of demographic stochasticity on allele fixation in long-lived species with low reproductive rates. This discrepancy is accentuated in the presence of demo-genetic feedback. Furthermore, we predict that populations with K life-histories should maintain lower genetic diversity than those with r life-histories.},

A number of studies have shown that when fitness is treated as a random variable, meaning that each individual has a distribution of possible fitness values, then both the mean and variance of individual fitness distributions contribute to directional evolution. Unfortunately the most general mathematical description of evolution that we have, the Price equation, is derived under the assumption that both fitness and offspring phenotype are fixed values that are known exactly. The Price equation is thus poorly equipped to study an important class of evolutionary processes.},

	abstract = {The assumption of constant population size is central in population genetics. It led to a large body of results, that are robust to modeling choices and that have proven successful to understand evolutionary dynamics. In reality, allele frequencies and population size are both determined by the interaction between a population and the environment. Relaxing the constant-population assumption have two big drawbacks. It increases the technical difficulty of the analysis, and it requires specifying a mechanism for the saturation of the population size, possibly making the results contingent on model details. Here, we develop a framework that encompasses a great variety of systems with an arbitrary mechanism for population growth limitation. By using techniques based on scale separation for stochastic processes, we are able to calculate analytically properties of evolutionary trajectories, such as the fixation probability. Remarkably, these properties assume a universal form with respect to our framework, which depends on only three parameters related to the inter-generation timescale, the invasion fitness, and the carrying capacity of the strains. In other words, different systems, such as Lotka-Volterra or a chemostat model (contained in our framework), share the same evolutionary outcomes after a proper re-mapping of their parameters. An important and surprising consequence of our results is that the direction of selection can be inverted, with a population evolving to reach lower values of invasion fitness.},
