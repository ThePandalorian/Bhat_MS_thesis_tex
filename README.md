This repository contains the TeX files required for compiling Ananda Shikhara Bhat's MS thesis at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune, India. The thesis was conducted under the supervision of [Dr. Vishwesha Guttal](https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/) and [Dr. Rohini Balakrishnan](https://sites.google.com/view/rohinibalakrishnanlab/home) at the Centre for Ecological Sciences in the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. [Dr. Sutirth Dey](https://sites.google.com/a/acads.iiserpune.ac.in/sdlab/pbl-iiser-p) from IISER Pune acted as the internal expert for evaluating the thesis.

The 'ind_files' folder contains individual TeX files for each chapter. Figures are stored in the 'Media' folder. One particular figure was generated in TikZ, and the code for this can be found in the 'backend' folder. <br>
A PDF of the thesis can be generated by compiling main.tex and using biber for the bibliography. If you are compiling from the command line and using pdflatex, this means running

```zsh
foo@bar:~ pdflatex main.tex
foo@bar:~ biber main
foo@bar:~ pdflatex main.tex
```

I have used a slightly modified version of the iiser-thesis.cls class file in which I have made minor changes to allow for co-supervisors and make chapter headings more aesthetic. The original iiser-thesis.cls file was created by [Dr. Anindya Goswami](https://sites.google.com/site/anindyagoswami/info) by modifying the [brandeis-dissertation.cls](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/brandeis-dissertation?lang=en) class.
